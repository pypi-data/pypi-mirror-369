Check version synchronization across all version files.

This script verifies that version numbers are consistent across all 
distribution channels and configuration files.

Version Synchronization Points:
1. Root VERSION file - Canonical Python version source
2. src/claude_mpm/VERSION file - Package distribution version
3. package.json - npm distribution version
4. Git tags - Ultimate source of truth (not checked here)

Why Version Sync Matters:
- Users may install from PyPI or npm
- Version mismatch causes confusion
- Documentation references specific versions
- Support requires knowing exact version
- Dependency resolution needs accurate versions

Usage:
- Run manually: ./scripts/check_version_sync.py
- Run in CI/CD pipelines before release
- Run after manual version updates
- Integrated into release.py for automated checks

Exit Codes:
- 0: All versions synchronized
- 1: Version mismatch or errors found

    Version Checking Process:
    1. Read root VERSION file (Python/PyPI version source)
    2. Read package VERSION file (distribution version)
    3. Read package.json (npm version)
    4. Compare all found versions
    5. Report mismatches or missing files
    
    Version Format:
    - Must be semantic version (X.Y.Z)
    - No suffixes or prefixes allowed
    - Must match exactly across all files
    
    Error Handling:
    - Missing files are reported as errors
    - Version mismatches show all versions
    - Clear indication of which file has which version
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if all versions match, False otherwise

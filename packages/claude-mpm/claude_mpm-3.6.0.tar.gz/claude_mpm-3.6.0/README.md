# Claude MPM - Multi-Agent Project Manager

A powerful orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables multi-agent workflows, session management, and real-time monitoring through an intuitive interface.

> **Quick Start**: See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in 5 minutes!

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent System**: Automatically delegates tasks to specialized agents (PM, Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer, Test Integration, Version Control)
- üß† **Agent Memory System**: Persistent learning with project-specific knowledge retention
- üîÑ **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions with `--resume` 
- üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with `--monitor` flag
- üìÅ **Multi-Project Support**: Per-session working directories
- üîç **Git Integration**: View diffs and track changes across projects
- üéØ **Smart Task Orchestration**: PM agent intelligently routes work to specialists

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install claude-mpm

# Install with development dependencies
pip install "claude-mpm[dev]"

# Install with agent dependencies (recommended for full functionality)
pip install "claude-mpm[agents]"

# Install with all optional dependencies
pip install "claude-mpm[agents,dev]"
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
claude-mpm

# Non-interactive with task
claude-mpm run -i "analyze this codebase" --non-interactive

# With monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor

# Resume last session
claude-mpm run --resume
```

### Agent Management

```bash
# View agent hierarchy and precedence
claude-mpm agents list --by-tier

# Inspect specific agent configuration
claude-mpm agents view engineer

# Fix agent configuration issues
claude-mpm agents fix --all --dry-run
```

For detailed usage, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)

### Agent Dependencies

Claude MPM automatically manages Python dependencies required by agents. Agents can declare their dependencies in their configuration files, and the system aggregates them for easy installation.

```bash
# Install all agent dependencies
pip install "claude-mpm[agents]"

# View current agent dependencies
python scripts/aggregate_agent_dependencies.py --dry-run

# Update pyproject.toml with latest agent dependencies
python scripts/aggregate_agent_dependencies.py
```

**Agent developers** can declare dependencies in their agent configurations:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "my_agent",
  "dependencies": {
    "python": ["pandas>=2.0.0", "numpy>=1.24.0"],
    "system": ["ripgrep", "git"]
  }
}
```

Dependencies are automatically aggregated from all agent sources (PROJECT > USER > SYSTEM) during the build process, with intelligent version conflict resolution taking the highest compatible version.

For comprehensive documentation, see [docs/AGENT_DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/AGENT_DEPENDENCIES.md).

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
The PM agent automatically delegates work to specialized agents:
- **Research**: Codebase analysis and investigation
- **Engineer**: Implementation and coding
- **QA**: Testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Docs and guides
- **Security**: Security analysis
- **Ops**: Deployment and infrastructure
- **Data Engineer**: Data pipelines and AI integrations
- **Test Integration**: E2E testing and cross-system validation
- **Version Control**: Git workflows and release management

**Three-Tier Agent System**: PROJECT > USER > SYSTEM precedence allows project-specific agent customization while maintaining fallbacks. Use `claude-mpm agents list --by-tier` to see the active agent hierarchy.

### Session Management
- All work is tracked in persistent sessions
- Resume any session with `--resume`
- Switch between projects with per-session directories
- View session history and activity

### Agent Memory System
Agents learn and improve over time with persistent memory:
- **Project-Specific Knowledge**: Automatically analyzes your codebase to understand patterns
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents remember insights across sessions
- **Memory Management**: Initialize, optimize, and manage agent memories
- **Quick Initialization**: Use `/mpm memory init` to scan project and create memories

```bash
# Initialize project-specific memories
claude-mpm memory init

# View memory status
claude-mpm memory status

# Add specific learning
claude-mpm memory add engineer pattern "Always use async/await for I/O"

# Start with monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor
```

See [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md) for comprehensive memory system documentation.

### Real-Time Monitoring
The `--monitor` flag opens a web dashboard showing:
- Live agent activity and delegations
- File operations with git diff viewer
- Tool usage and results
- Session management UI

See [docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md](docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md) for full monitoring guide.

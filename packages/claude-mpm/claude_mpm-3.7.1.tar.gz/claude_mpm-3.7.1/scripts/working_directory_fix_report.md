# Working Directory Fix Verification Report

## Summary

The working directory fix has been successfully implemented and is functioning correctly in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Implementation Details

The fix consists of two main components:

### 1. Bash Script (`scripts/claude-mpm`)
- Line 73: Preserves the user's original working directory in `CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD`
- Line 118: Changes to the framework directory for proper Python module execution

### 2. Python Module (`src/claude_mpm/core/simple_runner.py`)

#### Interactive Mode (lines 199-207):
```python
if 'CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD' in clean_env:
    user_pwd = clean_env['CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD']
    clean_env['CLAUDE_WORKSPACE'] = user_pwd
    try:
        os.chdir(user_pwd)
        self.logger.info(f"Changed working directory to: {user_pwd}")
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.warning(f"Could not change to user directory {user_pwd}: {e}")
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode (lines 316-326):
```python
if 'CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD' in env:
    user_pwd = env['CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD']
    env['CLAUDE_WORKSPACE'] = user_pwd
    try:
        original_cwd = os.getcwd()
        os.chdir(user_pwd)
        self.logger.info(f"Changed working directory to: {user_pwd}")
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.warning(f"Could not change to user directory {user_pwd}: {e}")
        original_cwd = None
```

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Directory Preservation
- The user's original directory is correctly preserved
- Claude Code receives the correct working directory
- Both `CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD` and `CLAUDE_WORKSPACE` are set properly

### ✅ File Access
- Files in the user's working directory are accessible
- Commands execute in the correct context
- Piped commands work correctly

### ✅ Non-Interactive Mode
- Working directory is correctly set before command execution
- Output shows the user's directory, not the framework directory
- Directory is restored after command completion

### ✅ Interactive Mode
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Working directory changes to user's original directory
- Claude Code sees the correct directory

## How It Works

1. **User runs claude-mpm from any directory**
   - Example: User is in `/home/user/myproject` and runs `claude-mpm`

2. **Bash script preserves the directory**
   - Sets `CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD=/home/user/myproject`
   - Changes to framework directory for Python execution

3. **Python module restores the directory**
   - Reads `CLAUDE_MPM_USER_PWD` 
   - Sets `CLAUDE_WORKSPACE` for Claude Code
   - Changes working directory back to `/home/user/myproject`

4. **Claude Code sees the correct directory**
   - Working directory is `/home/user/myproject`
   - Can access files in that directory
   - Commands execute in the correct context

## Manual Verification Steps

To manually verify the fix:

1. **Non-Interactive Mode:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   echo "test file" > test.txt
   /path/to/claude-mpm run -i "pwd && ls -la test.txt" --non-interactive
   ```
   Should show `/tmp` and the test file.

2. **Interactive Mode:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   /path/to/claude-mpm
   # In Claude, type: pwd
   ```
   Should show `/tmp`, not the claude-mpm directory.

## Conclusion

The working directory fix is fully implemented and operational. Users can now run claude-mpm from any directory and Claude Code will correctly see and work with files in that directory, resolving the original issue where Claude Code would always see the framework directory instead of the user's working directory.

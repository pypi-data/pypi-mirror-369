# Script to publish both PyPI and npm packages
#
# OPERATIONAL PURPOSE:
# Legacy build script for manual package distribution. Superseded by release.py
# which provides automated version management and synchronized releases.
# Kept for emergency manual releases and troubleshooting.
#
# DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:
# 1. Verifies clean git working directory
# 2. Extracts version from Python package
# 3. Synchronizes npm package.json version
# 4. Builds Python distribution packages
# 5. Provides manual upload commands
#
# OPERATIONAL NOTES:
# - This script builds but does NOT publish automatically
# - Manual upload commands prevent accidental releases
# - Use release.py for automated deployments
# - Useful for testing package builds without publishing
#
# PREREQUISITES:
# - Python build tools: pip install build twine
# - npm installed and configured
# - PyPI credentials in ~/.pypirc
# - npm credentials via npm login
#
# MONITORING:
# - Check dist/ directory for built packages
# - Verify package sizes are reasonable (200-300KB)
# - Ensure both .tar.gz and .whl files are created
# - Confirm package.json version matches VERSION file
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - Import error: Ensure src/ is in PYTHONPATH
# - Build fails: Check setup.py configuration
# - Version mismatch: Run manage_version.py first
# - npm error: Verify npm is installed and logged in

set -e  # Exit on any error - critical for deployment safety

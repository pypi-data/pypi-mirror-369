# Claude MPM - Multi-Agent Project Manager

A powerful orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables multi-agent workflows, session management, and real-time monitoring through an intuitive interface.

> **Quick Start**: See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in 5 minutes!

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent System**: Automatically delegates tasks to specialized agents (PM, Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer, Test Integration, Version Control)
- üß† **Agent Memory System**: Persistent learning with project-specific knowledge retention
- üîÑ **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions with `--resume` 
- üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with `--monitor` flag
- üìÅ **Multi-Project Support**: Per-session working directories
- üîç **Git Integration**: View diffs and track changes across projects
- üéØ **Smart Task Orchestration**: PM agent intelligently routes work to specialists

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install claude-mpm
```

**That's it!** See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for immediate usage or [docs/user/installation.md](docs/user/installation.md) for advanced options.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Start interactive mode (recommended)
claude-mpm

# Start with monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for complete usage examples.


## Architecture

Claude MPM v3.8.2+ features a **modern service-oriented architecture** with interface-based design, dependency injection, and intelligent caching for 50-80% performance improvements.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture information.

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
The PM agent automatically delegates work to specialized agents including Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer, Test Integration, and Version Control.

### Agent Memory System
Agents learn project-specific patterns and remember insights across sessions. Initialize with `claude-mpm memory init`.

### Real-Time Monitoring
The `--monitor` flag opens a web dashboard showing live agent activity, file operations, and session management.

See [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md) and [docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md](docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md) for details.

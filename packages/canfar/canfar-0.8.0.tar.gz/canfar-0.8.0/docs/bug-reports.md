# Bug Reports

Thank you for taking the time to report a bug! Your feedback helps us improve Canfar for everyone. This guide will help you create effective bug reports that enable us to quickly identify and fix issues.

## Before Reporting a Bug

Before creating a new bug report, please:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if the bug has already been reported in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/opencadc/canfar/issues)
2. **Update to the latest version**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Canfar Client
3. **Check the documentation**: Review our [documentation](https://opencadc.github.io/canfar/) to confirm the expected behavior

## How to Report a Bug

### Gather System Information

Before reporting a bug, collect detailed system information using the Canfar CLI:

```bash
canfar version --debug
```

This command provides comprehensive information about your environment, including:

- **Client Information**: Canfar version, git commit info, and installation method
- **Python Environment**: Python version, executable path, and implementation
- **System Details**: Operating system, version, architecture, and platform
- **Dependencies**: Versions of key packages that might affect functionality

### Create a Detailed Bug Report

When creating your bug report, include the following sections:

1. **Bug Description**: 
    Provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is,
    - What you were trying to do
    - What actually happened
    - What you expected to happen
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: List the exact steps to reproduce the behavior, including any relevant commands and options.
3. **Expected Behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen instead
4. **System Information**: Include the complete output from `canfar version --debug`
5. **Error Messages and Logs**: Include any error messages, stack traces, or relevant log output. Use code blocks to format them properly.
6. **Screenshots (if applicable)**: Include screenshots that might help explain the problem
7. **Additional Context**: Add any other context about the problem, such as
    - When the issue started occurring
    - Whether it happens consistently or intermittently
    - Any workarounds you've found
    - Related configuration or environment details

This module improves the **Field Service Kanban view** by displaying
essential job details directly on the order cards. The **scheduled time
range**, **customer address**, and **contact details** (phone and
mobile) are visible at a glance, providing technicians with the most
relevant information without needing to open the order.

Field Service operations depend on **speed, clarity, and efficiency**.
By surfacing key information in the Kanban view, this module helps
technicians **prioritize tasks**, **streamline their workflow**, and
**improve customer communication** â€” all while minimizing unnecessary
clicks. The flexible configuration of the **scheduled time range
format** ensures the displayed information adapts to the user's
preferred **date and time formats**, making the Kanban view both
intuitive and consistent across different regions and languages.

This module improves the **Field Service Kanban view** by displaying
essential job details directly on the order cards. The **scheduled time
range**, **customer address**, and **contact details** (phone and
mobile) are visible at a glance, providing technicians with the most
relevant information without needing to open the order.

Field Service operations depend on **speed, clarity, and efficiency**.
By surfacing key information in the Kanban view, this module helps
technicians **prioritize tasks**, **streamline their workflow**, and
**improve customer communication** â€” all while minimizing unnecessary
clicks. The flexible configuration of the **scheduled time range
format** ensures the displayed information adapts to the user's
preferred **date and time formats**, making the Kanban view both
intuitive and consistent across different regions and languages.

Usage
=====

- Navigate to Field Service.

- Create or edit a Field Service Order.

- In the Kanban view, the scheduled time range is automatically computed
  based on the **Scheduled Start (ETA)** and **Scheduled End** fields.
  The customer address and contact details (partner's phone and mobile)
  are also displayed on the order card, if set.

- To configure the format of the scheduled time range, go to
  **Configuration > Settings > Technical > Orders > Schedule Time Range
  Format** to choose between **time range only format** (e.g. 15:30 -
  17:30) or **date and time range format**.

- Regarding the date and time range format, if the schedule_date_start
  and schedule_date_end fields fall on the same date, the date is
  displayed only once (e.g. 19/02/2025 15:30 - 17:30). If the dates
  differ, both the start and end dates are displayed (e.g. 19/02/2025
  15:30 - 20/02/2025 17:30).

- The date and time format respects the user's language settings and
  their associated date and time format.

  - For example, if the user's language date format is set to
    ``%m/%d/%Y`` (e.g. **02/19/2025**) with a time format of
    ``%I:%M %p`` (e.g. **3:30 PM**), the scheduled time range will be
    displayed as **02/19/2025 3:30 PM - 02/19/2025 5:30 PM**.

  -If the user's language date format is set to ``%d/%m/%Y`` (e.g.
  **19/02/2025**) and a time format of ``%H:%M:%S`` (e.g. **15:30:00**),
  the scheduled time range will be displayed as **19/02/2025 15:30 -
  19/02/2025 17:30**.

As you may have noticed, our logo features a beautiful "loro tricahue" or burrowing parrot[(_Cyanoliseus patagonus bloxami_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_parrot); a bird native to Chile and Argentina known for its distinctive colors green on head and body, red and yellow on the chest, and a blue tail. These parrots excavate burrows on cliff faces or ravines that are connected forming a complex system of tunnels and chambers[.](https://youtu.be/v2AC41dglnM)

# /sg:implement - Feature Implementation

## Purpose
Implement features, components, and code functionality with intelligent expert activation and comprehensive development support.

## Usage
```
/sg:implement [feature-description] [--type component|api|service|feature] [--framework react|vue|express|etc] [--safe]
```

## Arguments
- `feature-description` - Description of what to implement
- `--type` - Implementation type (component, api, service, feature, module)
- `--framework` - Target framework or technology stack
- `--safe` - Use conservative implementation approach
- `--iterative` - Enable iterative development with validation steps
- `--with-tests` - Include test implementation
- `--documentation` - Generate documentation alongside implementation

## Execution
1. Analyze implementation requirements and detect technology context
2. Auto-activate relevant personas (frontend, backend, security, etc.)
3. Coordinate with MCP servers (Magic for UI, Context7 for patterns, Sequential for complex logic)
4. Generate implementation code with best practices
5. Apply security and quality validation
6. Provide testing recommendations and next steps

Follow the execution steps outlined above and provide a comprehensive response based on the specified parameters.

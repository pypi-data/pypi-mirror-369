components:
  - name: "chain_of_thought"
    description: "Step-by-step reasoning approach"
    content: |
      Think through this step by step:
      1. First, understand what is being asked
      2. Break down the problem into smaller parts
      3. Work through each part systematically
      4. Combine your findings to reach a conclusion
      5. Double-check your reasoning before providing the final answer

  - name: "pros_and_cons"
    description: "Analyze advantages and disadvantages"
    content: |
      Analyze this by considering both sides:
      
      **Pros (Advantages):**
      - List positive aspects
      - Consider benefits and opportunities
      
      **Cons (Disadvantages):**  
      - List negative aspects
      - Consider risks and drawbacks
      
      Then weigh these factors to form a balanced conclusion.

  - name: "first_principles"
    description: "Reasoning from fundamental truths"
    content: |
      Apply first principles thinking:
      1. Break down the problem to its fundamental elements
      2. Question assumptions and identify what we know for certain
      3. Reason up from these basic truths
      4. Build understanding from the ground up
      5. Avoid reasoning by analogy or convention

  - name: "five_whys"
    description: "Root cause analysis through repeated questioning"
    content: |
      Use the "Five Whys" technique to get to the root cause:
      1. Ask "Why?" about the problem
      2. For each answer, ask "Why?" again  
      3. Continue this process at least 5 times
      4. This will help uncover the underlying root cause
      5. Address the root cause rather than just symptoms

  - name: "scenario_analysis"
    description: "Consider multiple potential outcomes"
    content: |
      Consider multiple scenarios:
      
      **Best Case Scenario:**
      - What would the optimal outcome look like?
      
      **Worst Case Scenario:**
      - What could go wrong?
      
      **Most Likely Scenario:**
      - What is the most probable outcome?
      
      Plan for each scenario and identify key factors that determine which scenario occurs.

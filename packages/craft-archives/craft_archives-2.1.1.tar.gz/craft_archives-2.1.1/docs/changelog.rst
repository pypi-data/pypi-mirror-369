See the `Releases page`_ on Github for a complete list of commits that are
included in each version.


2.1.1 (2025-08-13)
-------------------

* Fix an issue where gpg times out when attempting to connect to the default
  key server. If the initial attempt fails, it now retries over TCP port 80
  and respects the system's HTTP proxy settings.

2.1.0 (2025-Feb-24)
-------------------

Features

* Allow installing apt packages for foreign architectures. This is supported
  in Ubuntu 24.04 or newer or on Ubuntu systems where the default sources file
  ``ubuntu.sources`` is in the `deb822`_ format.

2.0.2 (2024-Dec-04)
-------------------

* Fix an issue where declaring a package-repository to an Ubuntu archive
  using the "https" scheme would cause an error in a later ``apt update``
  when in Noble.

2.0.1 (2024-Oct-21)
-------------------

* Fix an issue where declaring a package-repository to an Ubuntu archive (for
  example, to add an architecture) would cause an error in a later ``apt
  update`` when in Noble.

2.0.0 (2024-08-08)
------------------

* Update minimum Python version to 3.10
* Require Pydantic 2

1.2.0 (2024-07-05)
------------------

* Support "series" and "pocket" in Apt package repositories.
* Support key-ids in PPAs.
* Add missing py.typed file.

1.1.3 (2023-08-04)
------------------

This release addresses a regression where package repository definitions
with declared ``architectures`` would cause an error when calling
``install()``. The fix also changes the behavior to only call
``dpkg --add-architecture`` when the target architecture is "compatible"
with the host's, meaning ``i386`` on ``amd64`` and ``armhf`` on ``amd64``.


1.1.2 (2023-07-12)
------------------

This release addresses a regression where local filepaths were no longer
accepted for the ``url`` property of an deb-type repository.

1.1.1 (2023-06-30)
------------------

This release addresses a regression where asset files with multiple
fingerprints (either from multiple keys or subkeys) were no longer accepted.

1.1.0 (2023-05-30)
------------------

- Add support for configuring Apt repositories in non-default roots

1.0.0 (2023-05-24)
------------------

This release marks the stability of craft-archives' API. Most of the work
has been on internal refactorings and tooling.

- Add support for Ubuntu Cloud Archive repositories
- Unify package repositories representations

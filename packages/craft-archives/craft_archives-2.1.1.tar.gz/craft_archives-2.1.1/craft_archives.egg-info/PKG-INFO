# Craft Archives

Craft Archives is a Python package to manage interaction with software package
repositories on behalf of tools using the [Craft Parts] library.

Craft Archives provides a set of common interfaces to define the locations of
and install new repositories.

It aims to provide a uniform, extensible set of interfaces that other tools and
packages can use when working with repositories.

This package is most useful for developers who write tools with [Craft Parts]
and need to provide support for additional software package repositories.

## Documentation

The [Craft Archives documentation][rtd-latest] provides guidance about
understanding and using the library.

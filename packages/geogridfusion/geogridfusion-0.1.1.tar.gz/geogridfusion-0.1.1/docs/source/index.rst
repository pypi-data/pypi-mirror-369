Welcome to GeoGridFusion!
==============================================================

GeoGridFusion enables scientists, researchers, and users to develop living stores 
of data relevant to their projects; make scientific computing outside of an HPC 
environment easier; enhances ease of reproducibility; stores geospatial data 
and interact with it lazily. Datasets grow overtime to suit users' needs.

.. The source code for pvdeg is hosted on `github <https://github.com/NREL/GeoGridFusion>`_. Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

See :ref:`tutorials` to learn how to use and experiment with various functionalities

How the Model Works
===================

Coupled with pvdeg for weather download, GeoGridFusion re-maps and stores geospatial gridded weather/meteorological data.

It is meant to be a simple package that allows for the storage of geospatial data incrementally, allowing total stored data to grow overtime.
Enabling the execution of geospatial analyses beyond the confines of NREL's high-performance computing capabilities.

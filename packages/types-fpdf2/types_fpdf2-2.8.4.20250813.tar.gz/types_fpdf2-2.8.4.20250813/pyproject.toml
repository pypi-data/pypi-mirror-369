## Typing stubs for fpdf2

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) type stub package for
the [`fpdf2`](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `fpdf2`. This version of
`types-fpdf2` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`fpdf2==2.8.4`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/fpdf2`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/fpdf2)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.16.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.403

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`6cae34647c8fa41060cd9de5a7de3ce6239b6b19`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/6cae34647c8fa41060cd9de5a7de3ce6239b6b19).

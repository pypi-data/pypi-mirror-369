"""
Handles all things FastAPI for the one-prompt-agents framework.

This includes setting up the FastAPI application instance, defining
Pydantic models for request and response validation, and registering
the HTTP API endpoints (like health checks and agent run triggers).
It relies on the main CLI module to populate its agent registry.

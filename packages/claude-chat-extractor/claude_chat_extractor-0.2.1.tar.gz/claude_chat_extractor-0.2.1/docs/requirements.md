# Requirements

## Overview
The Claude Conversation Extractor is a command-line tool designed to extract specific conversations from Claude export files and convert them to readable markdown format.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Status: COMPLETE âœ…

**All functional and non-functional requirements have been successfully implemented and tested.** The tool is production-ready and has been validated with real Claude export data containing 728+ conversations.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality âœ… IMPLEMENTED
1. **Conversation Extraction**: Extract a specific conversation by UUID from a Claude export file
2. **Markdown Conversion**: Convert the extracted conversation to well-formatted markdown
3. **File Output**: Save the converted conversation to a markdown file
4. **Conversation Listing**: List available conversations in an export file

### Input Requirements âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Export File**: JSON file containing Claude conversation data
- **Conversation UUID**: Unique identifier for the target conversation
- **Output Path**: Optional path for the output markdown file

### Output Requirements âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Markdown Format**: Clean, readable markdown with proper structure
- **Metadata**: Include conversation details (UUID, timestamps, account info)
- **Message Formatting**: Clear distinction between human and Claude messages with emojis
- **Timestamps**: Human-readable timestamps for all messages
- **Attachments**: Display file and attachment information when available

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Handle large export files efficiently using streaming JSON parsing
- Fast UUID lookup and extraction with constant memory usage
- Minimal memory usage during processing (tested with 44MB+ files)

### Usability âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Intuitive command-line interface with Click framework
- Clear error messages and help text
- Verbose mode for debugging
- Progress indicators and rich formatting with Rich library

### Reliability âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Graceful error handling for malformed data
- Validation of input file format using Pydantic models
- Safe file operations with proper exception handling

### Compatibility âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Support Python 3.12+
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Handle various JSON export formats with flexible parsing

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Click**: Command-line interface framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Rich**: Enhanced terminal output and formatting
- **ijson**: Streaming JSON parser for memory efficiency

### Architecture âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for extraction, conversion, and CLI
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase with MyPy validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and logging

### Testing âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Unit tests for core functionality (7 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Test coverage for error conditions
- Mock-based testing for file operations and JSON parsing

## Additional Implemented Features

### Streaming JSON Processing âœ…
- Uses `ijson` library for memory-efficient processing
- Processes large files without loading entire content into memory
- Maintains constant memory usage regardless of file size

### Rich CLI Experience âœ…
- Beautiful terminal output with colors and emojis
- Progress indicators and status messages
- Professional error reporting and help text

### Data Models âœ…
- Complete Pydantic models for all data structures
- Validation of Claude export file format
- Type-safe processing throughout the pipeline

### Command Line Interface âœ…
- Two main commands: `extract` and `list-conversations`
- Multiple command aliases for convenience
- Comprehensive help and usage information
- Verbose mode for debugging and monitoring

## Validation Results

The tool has been successfully tested with:
- **Real Data**: 728 conversations from actual Claude export
- **Large Files**: 44MB+ export files processed efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: Constant memory footprint during processing
- **Performance**: Fast UUID lookup and extraction
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation

## Future Enhancements

While all core requirements are met, potential future improvements could include:
- Batch processing of multiple conversations
- Additional output formats (HTML, PDF)
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Integration with external tools and APIs

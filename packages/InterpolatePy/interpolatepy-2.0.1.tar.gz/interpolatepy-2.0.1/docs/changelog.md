## Development Guidelines

### Version Numbering

InterpolatePy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.1.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Pre-release Versions

- **Alpha**: `2.1.0a1` - Early development, API may change
- **Beta**: `2.1.0b1` - Feature complete, testing phase
- **Release Candidate**: `2.1.0rc1` - Final testing before release

### Release Process

1. **Feature Development**: Work on `dev` branch
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite must pass
3. **Documentation**: Update docs for all changes
4. **Changelog**: Document all notable changes
5. **Version Bump**: Update version in `interpolatepy/version.py`
6. **Release**: Create GitHub release and publish to PyPI

### Deprecation Policy

- **Deprecation Warning**: Mark features as deprecated one major version before removal
- **Migration Guide**: Provide clear migration paths for breaking changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility within major versions when possible

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

#### API Changes

**Old (1.x)**:
```python
from interpolatepy import CubicSpline
spline = CubicSpline(t_points, q_points)
# Evaluation method names varied
result = spline.eval(t)
```

**New (2.0)**:
```python
from interpolatepy import CubicSpline
spline = CubicSpline(t_points, q_points, v0=0.0, vn=0.0)
# Consistent evaluation methods
result = spline.evaluate(t)
```

#### Parameter Changes

- Boundary conditions now explicit (v0, vn parameters)
- Consistent parameter naming across all algorithms
- Better default values for optional parameters

#### New Features to Adopt

1. **Enhanced Documentation**: Check new tutorials and examples
2. **Quaternion Interpolation**: Use for 3D rotation trajectories
3. **Advanced Splines**: Try acceleration-constrained variants
4. **Vectorized Evaluation**: Use array inputs for better performance

#### Performance Improvements

- All algorithms now support vectorized evaluation
- Memory usage reduced by 20-30% for large trajectories
- Evaluation speed improved by 50-100% in many cases

"""
Efficient tridiagonal matrix solver using the Thomas algorithm.

This module provides optimized solutions for tridiagonal linear systems that arise
frequently in spline interpolation and other numerical methods. The Thomas algorithm
offers O(n) complexity compared to O(n³) for general matrix solvers.

    """
    Solve a tridiagonal system using the Thomas algorithm.

    This function solves the equation Ax = b where A is a tridiagonal matrix.
    The system is solved efficiently using the Thomas algorithm (also known as
    the tridiagonal matrix algorithm).

    Parameters
    ----------
    lower_diagonal : np.ndarray
        Lower diagonal elements (first element is not used).
        Must have the same length as main_diagonal.
    main_diagonal : np.ndarray
        Main diagonal elements.
    upper_diagonal : np.ndarray
        Upper diagonal elements (last element is not used).
        Must have the same length as main_diagonal.
    right_hand_side : np.ndarray
        Right-hand side vector of the equation.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Solution vector x.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a pivot is zero during forward elimination.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])  # Lower diagonal (a[0] is not used)
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5])  # Main diagonal
    >>> c = np.array([1, 2, 3, 0])  # Upper diagonal (c[-1] is not used)
    >>> d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Right hand side
    >>> x = solve_tridiagonal(a, b, c, d)
    >>> print(x)

    Notes
    -----
    The Thomas algorithm is a specialized form of Gaussian elimination for
    tridiagonal systems. It is much more efficient than general Gaussian
    elimination, with a time complexity of O(n) instead of O(n³).

    The algorithm consists of two phases:
    1. Forward elimination to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form
    2. Back substitution to find the solution

    For a system where the matrix A is:
        [b₀ c₀  0  0  0]
        [a₁ b₁ c₁  0  0]
        [0  a₂ b₂ c₂  0]
        [0   0 a₃ b₃ c₃]
        [0   0  0 a₄ b₄]

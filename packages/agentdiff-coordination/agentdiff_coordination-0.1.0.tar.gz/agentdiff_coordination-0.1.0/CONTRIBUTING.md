## Areas for Contribution

### **TOP PRIORITY: Framework Integration Testing**

**We need your help testing AgentDiff Coordination with popular AI frameworks!**

We couldn't test with all frameworks due to time constraints. **This is the #1 contribution we need:**

- **CrewAI** - Multi-agent framework integration
- **AutoGen** - Microsoft's conversational AI framework
- **LangChain** - LLM application framework
- **LlamaIndex** - Data framework for LLMs
- **Haystack** - End-to-end NLP framework
- **Rasa** - Conversational AI platform

**What we need:**

- Integration examples showing AgentDiff coordination with these frameworks
- Test cases demonstrating resource protection and event coordination
- Documentation for common integration patterns
- Performance benchmarks and optimization suggestions

**Why this matters:**

- These frameworks are widely used in production
- Integration issues are blocking adoption
- Real-world testing reveals edge cases we missed

### High Priority

- **Integration documentation** - Guides for popular AI frameworks
- **Performance optimizations** - Make coordination even faster
- **More examples** - Real-world integration examples

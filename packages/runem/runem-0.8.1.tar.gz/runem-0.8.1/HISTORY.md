(unreleased)
------------
- Merge pull request #91 from lursight/fix/module_job_paths. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Fix/module job paths
- Fix(module-job): adds .runem.yml dir to sys.path allowing dynamically
  import when *installed* [Frank Harrison]

  The dynamic imports were working locally, where the runem module was
  "local" to the `module` dot-path BUT when `runem` was installed as a
  thridparty the dynamic import of the `module` path would fail. This
  works around that issue by adding the `.runem.yml` dir-path to the
  `sys.path`, which means the `module` config type will always work when
  the import path is relative to `.runem.yml`, which matches some of the
  rest of the code.

  We should, at some point, consider allowing configuring a path that can
  define an extra sys.path to add, or something neater.
- Fix(module-job): much better error messages. [Frank Harrison]

  This gives better direction and information when `module` path import
  fails.
- Fix(module-job): fixes typo in comment. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(module-job-e2e): adds the module job-type into the e2e as an
  opt-in. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(module-job-e2e): refactors out all dummy data from e2e. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Just to make the function's *intent* easier to grok at a glance, it
  might make it harder to read and reason about whilst debbugging but I
  think that's an ok trade-off to get:

  1. faster understanding when seeing the code from a cold-start (e.g.
  after some time has passed)
  2. sharable code.
- Chore(module-job-e2e): renames an e2e parameter to match the
  underlying intent. [Frank Harrison]

  It was just a bit confusing to follow which mock was pointing at which
  function; this clarifies that.


0.8.0 (2025-08-13)
------------------
- Release: version 0.8.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #90 from lursight/feat/dot-notation_module_lookup.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/dot notation module lookup
- Feat(module-job): more test coverage. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(module-job): initial support for module-path. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(module-job): adds docs. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(test-utils): moves shared utils out of test-file. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This should enable better sharing but also limit the tests run (if the
  import of test_runem also caused test_runem's test to be run once for
  each import, which IIRC used to happen).
- Merge branch 'chore/better_docs' [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(docs): further docs improvements and typo fixing. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Merge pull request #88 from lursight/chore/mkdocs_deploy. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Chore/mkdocs deploy
- Chore(docs): updates misc docs, paths and urls. [Frank Harrison]

  ... making them easier to read, navigate, and discover.

  Overall this is just a bit more sensible than previous.
- Chore(docs): deploy mkdocs instead of jekyll docs. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #86 from
  lursight/dependabot/github_actions/actions/checkout-5. [Frank
  Harrison]

  chore(deps): bump actions/checkout from 4 to 5

0.7.1 (2025-04-23)
------------------
- Release: version 0.7.1 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #85 from lursight/feat/better_function-not-
  found_error. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/better function not found error
- Feat(function-lookup-error): exits instead of reraising errors looking
  for functions. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(coloured-function-lookups): colours the function errors. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Merge pull request #84 from lursight/fix/log-wrapping. [Frank
  Harrison]

  fix(log-wrapping): fixes log wrapping so it does not truncate
- Fix(log-wrapping): fixes log wrapping so it does not truncate. [Frank
  Harrison]

  I used printing of multiple variants to find this switch. This happened
  because `soft_wrap=True` implies that it is turning on a line-break or
  similar system *instead of* turning off hard-wrapping, so it should be
  `hard_wrap=False` or similar.


0.7.0 (2025-04-21)
------------------
- Release: version 0.7.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #83 from
  lursight/feat/no_runem_traceback_on_job_fail. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/no runem traceback on job fail
- Feat(error-only): only shows the error not the runem error tracback.
  [Frank Harrison]

  The runem error traceback is irelevant if the sub-task fails. So we just
  show that task's output instead of the traceback for where we handle the
  error.
- Feat(error-ctx): shows the failed job label as we show the causing
  error. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(remove-failed): always remove the failed job from the list of
  running jobs. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #82 from lursight/feat/schema_validation. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Harrison]

  Chore/update deps
- Chore(deps): updates pylint 3.1.0 -> 3.3.6. [Frank Harrison]

  [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #79 from
  lursight/feat/removes_dectorate_param_from_log. [Frank Harrison]

  feat(log): changes the semantics of log's 'decorate' to allow overriding
- Feat(log): changes the semantics of log's 'decorate' to allow
  overriding. [Frank Harrison]

  Also renames the log API's param decorate -> prefix.

  This better represents the intent of the param as decorate was adding a
  default prefix.


0.6.0 (2025-02-03)
------------------
- Release: version 0.6.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #78 from lursight/feat/better_error_display. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/better error display
- Fix(spinner): fixes the Spinner show it only shows for --show-spinner.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Also, fixes it so that it shows only a single spinner
- Feat(colours): adds better colours to the terminal output. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This helps to reinfoce time-saved and other aspects of the tool.
- Feat(better-errors): makes finding the stderr in the list of errors
  easier. [Frank Harrison]

  We do this by colouring the text for the commands and wrapping the
  errors with a red-box.

  We colour:
  - command-lines -> yellow
  - job-labels -> blue
  - errors -> red
  - in-progress -> green box
- Merge pull request #77 from lursight/fix/log-verbosity. [Frank
  Harrison]

  fix(log-verbosity): fixes verbosity bug when not showing the spinner
- Fix(log-verbosity): fixes verbosity bug when not showing the spinner.
  [Frank Harrison]

  We were showing the running procs on every tick, instead of just the
  changes to the running procs, if any.
- Merge pull request #76 from lursight/chore/types/job-return-type.
  [Frank Harrison]

  chore(types) fixes exports for JobReturn type

0.5.0 (2024-12-12)
------------------
- Release: version 0.5.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #71 from lursight/feat/pyproject. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/pyproject
- Feat(pyproject): changes how we chose to install deps during a runem
  deps-install. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(pyproject): tests the build works in ci/cd. [Frank Harrison]

  I'd rather find out that this has failed before we get to the deploy-phase.
- Feat(pyproject): makes the version dynamic again, reading from the
  VERSION file. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(pyproject): ports setup.py to pyproject.toml, more future proof.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Makes the project more future-proof by moving to pyproject.

0.4.0 (2024-12-03)
------------------
- Release: version 0.4.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #67 from lursight/feat/prettier_logging. [Frank
  Harrison]

  feat(rich): prettier logging with rich
- Feat(rich): disable markup handling. [Frank Harrison]

  We got errors running logging through rich in CiCd where
  [/path/to/thing] was being seen as rich markup, specifically as a rich
  markup close-tag.

  This stops parsing strings as markup and therefore works around the
  error.
- Feat(rich): prettier logging with rich. [Frank Harrison]

  It also makes the logging more useful in different contexts by removing
  tabs and so on.


0.3.0 (2024-12-03)
------------------
- Release: version 0.3.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #66 from
  lursight/feat/option_switches_in_simple_commands. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/option switches in simple commands
- Chore(pytest): force colour output in pytest, makes it easier to read.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(option-switches): adds ability to turn on/off switches in simple
  commands. [Frank Harrison]

  THis is pretty noddy for now, but it means we can do more things like
  run `black` or `ruff` with `--check` enabled... as well as some other
  switches.
- Merge pull request #65 from lursight/feat/error_on_misplaced_config.
  [Frank Harrison]

0.1.2 (2024-11-18)
------------------
- Release: version 0.1.2 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(actions): simplifies code paths for actions. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(contrib): removes the Makefile commands that have been removed.
  [Frank Harrison]

  .. this should have been in the last PR.
- Chore(contrib): update the CONTRIBUTING docs and removes defunct
  scripts from Makefile. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(faster-actions): removes redundant github actions. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This should speed up github actions, but it may lead to more false-positives as we are relying on runem to be working and realiabel to run our own checks....

  This could come back to bite us.
- Chore(extra-ctx): adds config_metadata to job kw-args. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This allows much greater depth of testing based on other jobs-inclusion and metadata.
- Chore(extra-ctx): moves the job-task calling to use kwargs explicitly.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(extra-ctx): sort kwargs passed to jobs. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #59 from lursight/chore/cleaner_type_exports.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Chore/cleaner type exports
- Chore(clean-types): fixes false-negative from 'isort --check' [Frank
  Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): makes the public_api the actual exported api of
  the types module. [Frank Harrison]

  I think this could be better
- Chore(clean-types): renames type_wip -> types. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): fixes up more of the test-hooks (badly named) for
  runem itself. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): splits out the rest of the types. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): moves config and serialisationtypes to own file.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): moves error into new errors.py types file. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): moves the types into types/wip whilst I work out
  the public API. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): splits out the job and hook execution types, ahead
  of building a better public api for type exports. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(clean-types): sorts the job kwargs. [Frank Harrison]


0.1.1 (2024-11-17)
------------------
- Release: version 0.1.1 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #58 from lursight/fix/completed_job_counts. [Frank
  Harrison]

  fix(complete-job-count): fixes and simplifies the in-progress report code
- Fix(complete-job-count): fixes and simplifies the in-progress report
  code. [Frank Harrison]

  The core problem was that the remaining-job-count didn't match the
  number of job-labels that were being shown.

  The root-cause was due to some of the job-tasks completing before the
  `_update_progress()` thread had started monitoring the jobs.

  We fix this by adding a new parameter to the job-executer that tracks
  when job completed. It's a very simple fix and reduces the overall
  complexity for about the same cost of threading-primitives.


0.1.0 (2024-11-17)
------------------
- Release: version 0.1.0 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #57 from lursight/feat/replace_halo_with_rich.
  [Frank Harrison]

  feat(rich): moves to using rich instead of halo for spinners
- Feat(rich): moves to using rich instead of halo for spinners. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Merge pull request #56 from lursight/feat/better_job_function_typing.
  [Frank Harrison]

  feat(better-job-function-typing): adds stronger typing for job and hook tasks
- Feat(better-job-function-typing): adds stronger typing for job and
  hook tasks. [Frank Harrison]

  We do this by typing the kwargs convenience variable, for which we need
  to use `Unpack` (for back compatibility), and `type_extensions` for
  cross-python-version compatibility (i.e. something that work for all
  targeted version of python).

  As a side-effect of this we get the benefit of seeing when and where we
  add extra data into the call-stack for `job_execute()` and it emerges
  that we only extend the key-word args when we are calling hooks in a
  non-threaded way, which makes sense.

  We do several things to achieve this:
    1. We have common parameters passed to both hooks and job-tasks
        - These common parameters make the hooks and job-task feel similar
          to develop.
    2. We put all hook-specific kwargs in one place, and mark each as
       optional.
        - this, for now, is mainly because we only have one hook, so this
          will likely change.
    3. We share and combine kwargs in a range of inheritance types, mainly
       to work with(/around?) python-typing, which isn't great in this
       type of situation.
- Chore(ignores): adds the tox/ dir to the ignores. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(ignores): update git ignore for coverage files and docs gen.
  [Frank Harrison]

  The docs are recent additions.
- Merge pull request #55 from lursight/chore/test_improvements. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Chore/test improvements
- Chore(coverage): reduce false-positives by deleteing old
  coverage_report files. [Frank Harrison]

  Sometimes we would have stale .coverage_report.* files left behind where
  from the multi-distributed pytest runs. These would lead more lines
  being reported as coverage than actual - aka false-positive test passes
  for coverage.
- Chore(help-tests): fixes the help output width in tests. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This reduces false-negative test results where we get word-splits in
  directories or between process counters or other dynamic content.

  This was due to the width of the terminal when the test was being run
  being variant with developer-machine. This uses a fixed-width output,
  reducing, if not stopping issues.
- Chore(deps): updates black 24.3.0 -> 24.10.0. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(deps): updates to latest pytest 8.1.1 -> 8.3.3 + plugins. [Frank
  Harrison]


0.0.32 (2024-11-17)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.32 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #54 from lursight/chore/use_tox_on_release. [Frank
  Harrison]

  chore(release): use tox on 'make release'
- Chore(release): use tox on 'make release' [Frank Harrison]

  This will run the checks across all versions, hopefully making
  everything more solid.
- Merge pull request #53 from lursight/dependabot/npm_and_yarn/cross-

- Merge pull request #49 from
  lursight/feat/allow_additional_files_to_be_checked. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/allow additional files to be checked
- Feat(file-controls): adds way to get files changed between branches.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This is useful if we want to do quick checks only on code that has
  changed since 'main' when pushing, or on a sibling branch or similar.

  For example, if we are using `--exec` in a rebase, we can start running
  check half-way through the list of commits, instead of every commit, but
  have the code check all files that have changes - meaning we can see the
  impact of changes throughout the branch, without working on *every*
  commit - sometimes this is very useful.
- Feat(file-controls): adds --always-files switch to force files to be
  checked. [Frank Harrison]

  Because of how we apply filters, filters for the files are applied
  before they're passed to the relevant jobs.

  This means that runem can now always check a subset of files, even if
  they're not in the HEAD or staged files, meaning we can verify if some
  files that we care about for a rebase or similar are copecetic.
- Merge pull request #52 from lursight/chore/pre-push_checks. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Chore/pre push checks

  [Frank Harrison]

  This will support pre-push hooks amongst other things, replacing
  ENV-variable that other projects I work on use.
- Chore(help-tests): fixes the tests when dirs are long. [Frank
  Harrison]

  If the dir-path was too long it would wrap and we could do a simple replace on it.
- Chore(help-tests): shows the failing output when the help comparrisons
  fail. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(help-tests): stops the help files being overwritten
  unexpectedly. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(typo): fixes argsparse -> argparse. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(tox): runs checks against multiple targets of python using tox.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(yarn): unconditionally installs yarn deps, at least once, in
  clean checkouts. [Frank Harrison]

  Reminder that we use yarn because it's simpler and better for
  spell-checking and git-hooks, mainly because the hooks get
  auto-installed when the yarn deps are installed.
- Chore(pretty): updates docs config file missed formatting after
  pervious PR. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #51 from lursight/chore/docs. [Frank Harrison]

  We split README into multiple mark-down files in docs/ allowing github
  pages to publish them via Jekyll.
- Chore(better-docs): configures Jekyll theme ahead of publish docs as
  pages. [Frank Harrison]

  We configure the docs in the root-dir so that the index of the Docs site
  is the same-same as the README.md at the root of the checkout.

  ... it is unlikely that --help will be used in verbose mode... probs. Sigh.
- Feat(user-local-cfg): gets user- and local- configs working. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Feat(user-local-cfg): splits the project loading into load and parse
  phases. [Frank Harrison]

  This is so we can use it to load user configs
- Feat(user-local-cfg): splits the config loading and the ConfigMetadata
  construction functions. [Frank Harrison]

  This allows re-using the parsing function for N files
- Feat(hooks): adds a hook system with support for ON_EXIT. [Frank
  Harrison]

  - we remove the deprecated function-type for jobs
  - we add support for hooks
  - add a hooks section to the .runem.yml reader
  - add a on-exit hook to the runem project's .runem.yml
- Merge pull request #42 from lursight/feat/prettier_tree_graph. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/prettier tree graph
- Feat(prettier-tree-report): changes how we index the leaver on the
  report-tree. [Frank Harrison]

  Basically removes the duplicate information, reducing visual noise,
  especially after adding the variously shaded bar-graphs
- Chore(.runem): uses current best practise for accessing options in
  runem's own jobs. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(.runem): connects the unit-test option to the runem python
  checks. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(.runem): removes defunct options. [Frank Harrison]

  These were left over from lursight's config
- Chore(.runem): rename switches for consistency. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(pretty-tree): adds extra test for bar-graph chars. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Chore: typo. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #41 from lursight/feat/prettier_tree_graph. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/prettier tree graph
- Feat(tree-graph): hangs all tree leaves off of the runem.phases.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(tree-graph): adds runem-reports regression checks. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This means we can capture any changes if they happen to the layout of
  the graph, as I intended to changed the layout next.

0.0.29 (2024-03-18)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.29 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #40 from lursight/fix/time_saved. [Frank Harrison]

  Fix/time saved
- Feat(prettier-bars): clarifies that total is user-space time. [Frank
  Harrison]

  ... not wall-clock or system-time
- Feat(prettier-bars): distiguishes the wall-clock bars. [Frank
  Harrison]

  ... from the total/sum and sub-job bars, so that it's slightly easier to
  see where the time is being really spent.
- Fix(time-saved): clarifies which measurement is the wall-clock time
  for the entire run. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(time-saved): add message about how long we _would_ have waited
  without runem. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(time-saved): renames all variable associated with timing reports.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This just makes someting which can become intractable/confusing a lot
  easier to follow.
- Fix(time-saved): check that time-saved is reported correctly. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Here we add a test first and then fix the missing math to calculate the
  time-saved by using runem. We broke this in the previous feature for
  rendering the tree slightly more elegantly.
- Feat(hide-single-leafs): only show the job when it has a single child.
  [Frank Harrison]

  We would get duplicated information for jobs which had single
  run_command invocations. This only shows sub-tasks/jobs if there are
  more than one sub-tasks meaning the output looks a lot nicer & clearer.
- Chore(deps): adds setuptools as a explicit dep. [Frank Harrison]

  ... otherwise we get the following error (more often in python 3.12),
  perhaps due to setuptools being removed from distros?:

  ```text
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
      from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
  ```
- Merge pull request #39 from lursight/feat/time_all_run_command_calls.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/time all run command calls
- Feat(pretty-tree): refactors out the phase-job report generator.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This is just to make pylint happy.
- Feat(pretty-tree): makes the report tree neater. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(time-all-sub-tasks): re-raise errors for context in ci/cd. [Frank
  Harrison]

  In github ci/cd we were hitting the asserts but had no context of where
  they're raised from or why. This should fix that if they still occur.
- Feat(time-all-sub-tasks): adds a test to test the time-recording
  functions. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(time-all-sub-tasks): adds all run_command times to report output.
  [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(type): uses a type-alias instead of manual type. [Frank
  Harrison]

- Merge pull request #36 from lursight/chore/more_python_versions_in_ci.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Chore/more python versions in ci
- Chore(github-ci): workaround for python 3.12 setuptools issue. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This fies what looks like an issue with pytest hooks running ci/cd (and
  on local machine) where we get:
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
- Chore(github-ci): updates the python `--help` tests for 3.11 (and
  later) [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): test python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 in ci. [Frank
  Harrison]

  We don't bother with 3.10 because we test 3.9 and boundaries for
  features are on the 3.11 version.

  We don't bother with earlier than 3.9, even though 3.8 is the earliest
  officially supported version.


0.0.28 (2024-03-01)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.28 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #35 from lursight/fix/aliases_not_setting_options.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Fix/aliases not setting options
- Switches the API so 'read-only' Options are the prominent type. [Frank
  Harrison]

  ... and Writable are the recessive type, making it easier for API users to ensure they're using the correct type
- Uses OptionsReadOnly, stopping accidentally overwritting options by
  individual jobs. [Frank Harrison]
- Adds a read-only version of the Options dict. [Frank Harrison]
- Ports Options type to an InformativeDict. [Frank Harrison]

  This shows you what options are available in the options dict if you
  look up a value that doesn't exist.
- Updates logging for clarity. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #34 from lursight/chore/github-actions. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Chore/GitHub actions
- Chore(github-ci): knocks out windows ci/cd for now. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): sets the windows ci to use utf-8. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): HACK ignore coverage in tested code. [Frank
  Harrison]

  It's not cler why the ci/cd thinks this isn't being hit, it is locally
  and I can't figure out why it wouldn't be on the ci/cd, perhaps it's
  down to the multithreaded pytest runs, but that would be
  non-deterministic. This will probably need looking into at some point.
- Chore(ci-coverage): updates the _get_jobs_matching test case. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Making it more explicit and easier to follow
- Chore(ci-coverage): fixes the help-test false-positive. [Frank
  Harrison]

  We were always writing the help"
- Chore(ci-coverage): adds test for
  test_run_command_basic_call_verbose_with_cwd. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(ci-coverage): ignores un-hit 'communicate' mock function. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): upload reports on failures. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): revert back to using the makefile for the redundant
  checks. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): installs yarn deps for ci job. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): makes the log output less verbose by using --no-
  spinner. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): moves the redundancy checks first to own job. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Chore(github-ci): runs two basic checks for redunancy during ci.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This should help catch errors where runem has been broken and returns a
  false-positive when run against itself.
- Chore(github-ci): runs runem against itself. [Frank Harrison]

  This could have drawbacks later so we will think about adding some
  redundancy to the ci checks.
- Merge pull request #33 from lursight/fix/mutiline_stdout. [Frank
  Harrison]

  fix(stdout-parsing): ensures that trailing newlines are handled
- Fix(stdout-parsing): ensures that trailing newlines are handled.
  [Frank Harrison]

  There will be a slight performance cost to this, hopefully not too much.


0.0.27 (2024-02-26)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.27 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #32 from lursight/feat/min-version_check. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/min version check
- Feat(min-version): adds support to check for minimum required runem
  version in config. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(min-version): adds --version switch. [Frank Harrison]

  and changes -v to be an alias for --version and not --verbose


0.0.26 (2024-02-25)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.26 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #31 from
  lursight/fix/exceptions_on_non_blocking_print. [Frank Harrison]

  fix(blocked-print): adds a 'blocking_print' function
- Fix(blocked-print): adds a 'blocking_print' function. [Frank Harrison]

  Sometimes in long-lasting jobs, that produce lots of output, we hit
  BlockingIOError where we can't print to screen because the buffer is full or
  already being written to (for example), i.e. the  would need to be a
  'blocking' call, which it is not.


0.0.25 (2024-02-24)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.25 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #30 from lursight/feat/stream_stdout. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/stream stdout
- Feat(stream-stdout): supports larger sub-process buffer sizes by using
  Popen. [Frank Harrison]

  This also allows us to stream the stdout to the console on verbose mode
- Chore(flake8): upgrades to latest flake8. [Frank Harrison]


0.0.24 (2024-02-13)

  [Frank Harrison]

  feat(cwd): adds cwd to run_command
- Feat(cwd): adds cwd to run_command. [Frank Harrison]

-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.22 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #27 from lursight/feat/add_cwd_to_run_command.
  [Frank Harrison]

  feat(cwd_in_run_command): allows cwd to be passed to run_command
- Feat(cwd_in_run_command): allows cwd to be passed to run_command.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This is despite the fact that runem already manually sets the cwd when running tasks
- Merge pull request #26 from
  lursight/chore/reudce_complexity_of_run_command. [Frank Harrison]

  chore(simplify-run_command): reduces the complexity of run_command
- Chore(simplify-run_command): reduces the complexity of run_command.

- Release: version 0.0.21 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]

  Harrison]

  feat(ctx-dir-tag): add the last directory name from the 'cwd' path as a tag
- Feat(ctx-dir-tag): add the last directory name from the 'cwd' path as
  a tag. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #23 from lursight/chore/update_docs. [Frank
  Harrison]

  chore(docs): improves docs slightly
- Chore(docs): improves docs slightly. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #22 from lursight/fix/help_text_test. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Fix/help text test
- Chore(cover-report-on-error): covers missed cases. [Frank Harrison]

  We weren't testing the exception handling-and-return cases of the code.
- Chore(fix-spinner-coverage): parameterises a test to cover no-show
  cases. [Frank Harrison]

  We didn't have coverage on the no-show-spinner cases. These parameters add
  that coverage.
- Chore(fix-tags-coverage): removed redundant code in get_tags. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This fixes coverage in get_tags by removing a case already covered.

  The case is one where we have already tested for the existence of valid
  tags and returned 'None', we were doing it twice.
- Fix(help-text-test): fixes the help output, again. [Frank Harrison]

  Adding more switches to runem cli changes the usage line significantly.
  This addresses that by only removing the problematic bit __main__ or -c
  and not the rest of the switches.

  We do this because the rest of the switches might be on the 'usage:'
  line or wrapped on the line below.

  The differences come from when running via xdist or single-threaded
  pytest and would presumably also manifest in other threaded environs
- Feat(one-line-commands): fixes typo in README. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #21 from lursight/feat/one_liners. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(one-line-commands): Update README.md reflecting all new features.
  [Frank Harrison]

  ... also clarifies various aspects and improves the "sell" i.e. why
  runem is useful.
- Feat(one-line-commands): adds troubleshooting documentation. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Feat(one-line-commands): documents oneliners. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(one-line-commands): simplifies the default tags. [Frank Harrison]

  ... mainly removing the unused 'UNTAGGED_TAG' flag as we favour 'None' now.
- Feat(one-line-commands): adds simple-command to the e2e tests. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This captures many more issues wit the new changes, enureing we 'know'
  what the output and behaviour is with these new types of jobs

  Also ensure tag tests work on ci/cd
- Feat(one-line-commands): adds simple-commands support to runem. [Frank
  Harrison]

  This is quite a big refactor to add one-liners to .runem.yml, improving
  the speed of on-boarding.

  This means that the quick route to use should be a .runem.yml file that
  looks something like:

  ```yml
  - job:
      command: echo "hello world!"
  ```

  instead of needing the following two files
  ```yml
  - job:
      addr:
        file: path/to/file.py
        function: _function_name
      label: Job Label
      when:
        phase: some_phase
        tags:
          - tag
  ```

  ```py
  from runem.run_command import run_command
  from typing import Any

  def _function_name(*kwargs:Any) -> None:
    run_command(["echo", "hello world"], **kwargs)
  ```

  So, that's 2 lines instead of 15 so 87% less code just to get started.

  Note that the key difference the 'address' and 'command' entries.

  Also note that almost all of the options are now optional. This means
  that the above function-addressed config can just be the following:

  ```yml
  - job:
      addr:
        file: path/to/file.py
        function: _function_name
      label: Job Label
  ```

  We use 'shlex' to avoid the word splitting problem when parsing commands
  to be run.

  There are some rough edges around tag handling, that we should tackle
  before releasing.
- Feat(one-line-commands): makes config-parsing unit-test explicit.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Adds specific exception checking for the case we are looking for ahead
  of changing the behaviour in this section.
- Feat(one-line-commands): moves the get_job_wrapper() manager to own
  file. [Frank Harrison]

  Clarifying that we have job-function variants move the selection
  function to its own file.
- Feat(one-line-commands): prepares get_job_wrapper() to support
  variants. [Frank Harrison]

  We are going to want to support multiple types of job-functions, so here
  we split out the get_job_wrapper() into the get_job_wrapper_py_func()
  variant ahead of adding a simple-command variant.
- Merge pull request #20 from lursight/chore/tidy. [Frank Harrison]

- Fix(align-bar-graphs): aligns floats with varying orders of magnitude.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Without this, when we have a task that take 1s and another that takes
  120, the bar graphs don't align and it's hard to see the comparison
- Fix(align-bar-graphs): changes tests to show the key issue with
  floats. [Frank Harrison]
- Feat(less-logging): reduce the amount of logging in verbose=False.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Most of the time you don't want lots of logging, you just want to
  run-and-done.
- Merge pull request #18 from
  lursight/feat/show_reports_even_on_failure. [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/show reports even on failure
- Fix(logging-consistency): adds a test against the output when a job-
  function raises. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(logging-consistency): adds stdout tests to the job_execute()
  tests. [Frank Harrison]

  This allows me to add a test to ensure the error output isn't shown
  twice in failed-command cases
- Feat(report-before-error): shows the available reports on error,
  before re-raising the error. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(logging-consistency): puts first stdout line with prefix. [Frank
  Harrison]


0.0.20 (2024-01-12)
-------------------
- Release: version 0.0.20 ðŸš€ [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #17 from lursight/feat/multiple_cwd. [Frank
  Harrison]

  Feat/multiple cwd
- Feat(multi-cwd): clones jobs for each cwd path given in .runem.yml.
  [Frank Harrison]

  Allows a job to have multiple cwds. That job will then be run once for
  each of those cwds.

  This make running individual commands across many project path much
  easier and faster as the normal is to run them in serial.

  This gives us reporting on each path bit as well as faster completion of
  tasks.
- Feat(multi-cwd): adds annotation to bit where we add jobs. [Frank
  Harrison]
- Chore(typo): fixes a typo in a variable. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(docs): removes defunct comment. [Frank Harrison]
- Fix(stdout): ensure the job filter log output is tidier and sorted.

  [Frank Harrison]

  Feat/in progress job count
- Feat(in-progress-job-count): shows num jobs completed in halo ticker.
  [Frank Harrison]

  This gives better feedback about what runem is doing to the user and
  reduces frustration for long-running tasks.
- Chore(coverage): adds more explicit coverage to code that will need it
  later. [Frank Harrison]
- Merge pull request #14 from lursight/chore/add_vscode_runner. [Frank

  chore(fix-mypy-config): ensures mypy catches all error (strict mode)
- Chore(mypy): upgrade mypy 1.7.0 -> 1.8.0. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(fix-mypy): fixes spurious test-types. [Frank Harrison]

  This is a heavier "fix" than just a chore, but not really a fix either.

  Basically the test was writing an invalid yml file and the code supported
  that bad behaviour. This replaces that buggy test with a correctly typed
  one and adds some earlier conformance to the config loader for a
  (hopefully) minor functional change.
- Chore(fix-mypy): fixes the various type issues. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(fix-mypy-config): adds noddy detector for if mypy.ini is
  invalid, as reported by mypy. [Frank Harrison]
- Chore(fix-mypy-config): fixes comments being included as option
  values. [Frank Harrison]

  We had comments after each option in mypy.ini which the mypy ini parser
  couldn't process. We put the comments first now.

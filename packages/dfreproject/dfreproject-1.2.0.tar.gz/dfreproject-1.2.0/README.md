The idea behind this package was to make a stripped down version of the `reproject` package affiliated with astropy in order to reduce computational time.
We achieve approximately 20X faster computations with this package using the GPU and 10X using the CPU for images taken by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Take a look at the demos for an example.
We note that the only projection we currently support is the Tangential Gnomonic projection which is the most popular in optical astronomy. 
If you have need for this package to work with another projection geometry, please open a GitHub ticket.

## Features

- Fast reprojection of astronomical images between different WCS frames
- Support for Simple Imaging Polynomial (SIP) distortion correction
- GPU acceleration using PyTorch
- Multiple interpolation methods (nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic)
- Simple high-level API and detailed low-level control

## Installation

### Using PyPi

If you want to install using PyPi (which is certainly the easiest way), you can simply run 

```bash
pip install dfreproject
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Astropy
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- cmcrameri

### Installing from Source

For the latest development version, install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DragonflyTelescope/dfreproject.git
cd dfreproject
pip install -e .
```

For development installation with documentation dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from astropy.io import fits
from astropy.wcs import WCS
from dfreproject import calculate_reprojection

# Load source and target images
source_hdu = fits.open('source_image.fits')[0]
target_hdu = fits.open('target_grid.fits')[0]
target_wcs = WCS(target_hdu.header)
# Perform dfreproject with bilinear interpolation
reprojected = calculate_reprojection(
    source_hdus=source_hdu,
    target_wcs=target_wcs,
    shape_out=target_hdu.data.shape,
    order='bilinear'
)

# Save as FITS
output_hdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=reprojected)
output_hdu.header.update(target_wcs.to_header())
output_hdu.writeto('reprojected_image.fits', overwrite=True)
```

The arguments for `calculate_reprojection` are the same as for the standard reprojection options in the reproject package such as `reproject_interp`, `reproject_adaptive`, or `reproject_exact`.
Therefore, it can be directly swapped for one of these by simply importing it with `from dfreproject import calculate_reprojection` and then using `calculate_reproject` instead of `reproject_interp`. 
This comes with the caveat that the flux calculation most closely mimics that to `reproject_interp`.



In another scenario, it may be more advantageous to use an array of data and the header object that have already been loaded into memory (i.e. not in a file/hdu object). In that case, follow this example:

```python
from astropy.io import fits
from astropy.wcs import WCS
from dfreproject import calculate_reprojection

# Load source and target images
source_hdu = fits.open('source_image.fits')[0]
source_data = source_hdu.data
target_hdu = fits.open('target_grid.fits')[0]
target_wcs = WCS(target_hdu.header)
# Perform dfreproject with bilinear interpolation
reprojected = calculate_reprojection(
    source_hdus=(source_data, source_hdu.header),
    target_wcs=target_wcs,
    shape_out=target_hdu.data.shape,
    order='bilinear'
)

# Save as FITS
output_hdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=reprojected)
output_hdu.header.update(target_wcs.to_header())
output_hdu.writeto('reprojected_image.fits', overwrite=True)
```

The `calculate_reprojection`` function will internally handle all the translation so that   the inputs are properly handled.



## Demos and Examples

A collection of example notebooks and scripts is available in the `demos` folder to help you get started:

- `reprojection-comparison.ipynb` - Simple example of reprojecting between two WCS frames and comparing the result of our implementation with the `reproject` package.
- `reprojection-comparison-mini.ipynb` - Example demonstrating the differences between `dfreproject` and `reproject` using different interpolation schema.
- `Coordinate-Comparison.ipynb` - A step-by-step walkthrough of our coordinate transformations with a comparison to `astropy.wcs`.

To run the demos:

```bash
cd demos
jupyter notebook
```

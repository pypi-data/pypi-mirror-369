### Data download and installation

1. Download the CAN data from the [CO2ForIT SharePoint][1].

2. Unzip the CAN data at
`2024Q2_Testdaten_Blankenhain/*/can_ifos_logs/CAN_logs.7z`.

3. If you're viewing this online, download the `CAN_Data_Explorer` directory.

4. Install the conda or [mamba][2]
Environment Manager if you don't have it yet
(You can check if you have it by typing `conda --version` on the command line).
If you only have conda, replace `mamba` with `conda` in the commands below.

5. Navigate to the CAN_Data_Explorer folder in the console. E.g.:

        cd /home/user/Downloads/CAN_Data_Explorer

6. Create a new environment from *environment.yml* file using:

        mamba env create -f environment.yml

### How to run the script

7. Run *CAN_Data_Explorer.py* in that environment. E.g.:

        mamba activate co2forit
        python -m CAN_Data_Explorer

8. Now the GUI should open.
    * Use the *Input Parameters* box to enter the locations of the CAN
    measurement files, the DBC file and the time period.
    * Use the *Fuel Calculator* tab to compute the fuel consumed in that time
    period.
    * Use the *Diagrams* tab to plot diagrams of selected CAN signals.
    The signal selection patterns are applied from top to bottom (like this: â†¯);
    every signal is only plotted once.
    The <kbd>?</kbd> button brings up a PDF that explains the available signals.
    Create the diagram by clicking on *Draw the figure.*
    The time needed to create the diagram is proportional to the duration of the
    selected time period.
    You can pan and zoom these diagrams and save them to disk.

9. You can also integrate the functions from this library in your own Python
scripts. See:

        python
        >>> import CAN_Data_Explorer as cde
        >>> help(cde)

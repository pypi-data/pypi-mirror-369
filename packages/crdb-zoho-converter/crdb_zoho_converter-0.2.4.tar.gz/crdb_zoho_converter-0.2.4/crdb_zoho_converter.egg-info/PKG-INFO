              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## CRDB → ZOHO Books Converter

Converts CRDB bank statements (XLS/XLSX) into the CSV format that can be imported into Zoho Books.

### Contents
- `convert_crdb_to_zoho.py`: CLI script for conversion
- `_inspect_xls.py`: small helper script to analyze new/changed XLS layouts
- `files/`: workspace for input/output files (ignored via `.gitignore`)

### Requirements
- Python 3.11 (or compatible)
- Windows PowerShell (examples below use PowerShell paths)
- Linux/macOS shells are supported (examples provided)
 - Dependencies: see `requirements.txt` (includes `pandas`, `xlrd`, `openpyxl`)

git clone https://github.com/lkasdorf/CRDB_con_2025.git && cd CRDB_con_2025
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Batch conversion (recommended)
crdb-convert --source source --dest converted

# Single file
crdb-convert -i source/statement.xlsx -o converted/statement.csv

# With mapping and per-row diagnostics
crdb-convert --source source --dest converted --map-file mapping.json --report-dir converted/reports
```

Windows (PowerShell):

crdb-convert --source source --dest converted

# Single file
crdb-convert -i source\statement.xlsx -o converted\statement.csv

# With mapping and per-row diagnostics
crdb-convert --source source --dest converted --map-file mapping.json --report-dir converted\reports
```

Alternative (global install via pipx):
```bash
pip install pipx && pipx ensurepath
pipx install .
crdb-convert --help
```

### Setup (recommended with virtual environment)
Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Windows (PowerShell):
1) Place the CRDB source file (e.g., `crdb_input.xls`) into `source/` for batch mode, or `files/` for single-file mode.
2) Batch conversion (recommended):
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe convert_crdb_to_zoho.py --source source --dest converted
```
3) Force re-run even if targets exist:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe convert_crdb_to_zoho.py --source source --dest converted --force
```
4) Single-file conversion (optional):
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe convert_crdb_to_zoho.py -i files\crdb_input.xls -o converted\crdb_input.csv
```

Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
1) Place the CRDB source file (e.g., `crdb_input.xls`) into `source/` for batch mode, or `files/` for single-file mode.
2) Batch conversion (recommended):
```bash
python3 convert_crdb_to_zoho.py --source source --dest converted
```
3) Force re-run even if targets exist:
```bash
python3 convert_crdb_to_zoho.py --source source --dest converted --force
```
4) Single-file conversion (optional):
```bash
python3 convert_crdb_to_zoho.py -i files/crdb_input.xls -o converted/crdb_input.csv
```
5) Import the generated CSV(s) from `converted/` into Zoho Books.

Inspector (optional):
```bash
crdb-inspect --help
crdb-inspect --input files/crdb_input.xls --engine auto --sheet 0 --max-scan-rows 500
```

### Installation (local/standalone)

Option A: Install into a virtual environment (recommended)
- Windows (PowerShell): see "Setup" above. Then:
```powershell
pip install -e .
```
- Linux/macOS:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
After this, the commands `crdb-convert` and `crdb-inspect` are available on your PATH.

Option B: System-wide via pipx (clean, isolated)
- Prerequisite: install `pipx` (`pip install pipx` and then `pipx ensurepath`).
```bash
pipx install .
```
You can now use the tools globally: `crdb-convert --help`.

Option C: Run directly with Python (no installation)
```bash
python3 convert_crdb_to_zoho.py --source source --dest converted
```

Optional: Build standalone binaries (no Python required on target system)
- Install PyInstaller and build binaries:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --name crdb-convert convert_crdb_to_zoho.py
pyinstaller --onefile --name crdb-inspect _inspect_xls.py
```
The generated binaries are in `dist/` (`crdb-convert`, `crdb-inspect`). They are OS/arch specific.

After installing/building:
- Show help: `crdb-convert --help`
- See examples under "Usage" and "CLI options".

### Install from PyPI (recommended for end users)
Using pipx (global, isolated; auto PATH integration):
```bash
pip install pipx && pipx ensurepath
pipx install crdb-zoho-converter
crdb-convert --help
```

Alternative with pip --user:
```bash
pip install --user crdb-zoho-converter
# Ensure ~/.local/bin (Linux/macOS) or the Windows user Scripts folder is on PATH
```

### Download prebuilt binaries (GitHub Releases)
Linux/macOS (download and add to PATH):
```bash
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/crdb-convert \
  https://github.com/lkasdorf/CRDB_con_2025/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/crdb-convert
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/crdb-convert
crdb-convert --help

# Optional inspector tool
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/crdb-inspect \
  https://github.com/lkasdorf/CRDB_con_2025/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/crdb-inspect
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/crdb-inspect
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
if (-Not (Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\bin")) { New-Item -ItemType Directory $env:USERPROFILE\bin | Out-Null }
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/lkasdorf/CRDB_con_2025/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/crdb-convert.exe -OutFile $env:USERPROFILE\bin\crdb-convert.exe
# Make it available on PATH for future sessions:
setx PATH "$env:PATH;$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
crdb-convert.exe --help

# Optional inspector tool
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/lkasdorf/CRDB_con_2025/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/crdb-inspect.exe -OutFile $env:USERPROFILE\bin\crdb-inspect.exe
```

### Add to PATH (so you can run `crdb-convert` from anywhere)

- Virtual environment (recommended): Activating the venv automatically adds its `Scripts` (Windows) or `bin` (Linux/macOS) folder to PATH.
  - Windows (PowerShell): `\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Linux/macOS (bash/zsh): `source .venv/bin/activate`

- pipx (global, isolated): Run `pipx ensurepath` once and restart your shell.
  - Verify: `which crdb-convert` (Linux/macOS) or `where crdb-convert` (Windows)

- pip --user (if you use it): Ensure the user bin directory is on PATH.
  - Linux/macOS: `~/.local/bin` (add to `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` if needed)
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  - Windows: Find your user base with `py -m site --user-base` or `python -m site --user-base`.
    Add its `Scripts` subfolder to PATH (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\Scripts`).

- PyInstaller binaries: Put the files from `dist/` into a directory already on PATH, or extend PATH.
  - Linux/macOS (temporary for current session):
    ```bash
    export PATH="$(pwd)/dist:$PATH"
    ```
  - Linux/macOS (permanent): add the same line to `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`.
  - Windows (PowerShell, permanent): Control Panel → Environment Variables → PATH → add `...\dist`. Or (with care):
    ```powershell
    setx PATH "$env:PATH;$(Get-Location)\dist"
    ```

- `--currency CODE|SYMBOL` currency code/symbol to strip (optional)

CSV formatting:
- `--encoding` output file encoding (default utf-8)
- `--quotechar` CSV quote character (default ")
- `--no-header` do not write CSV header row

Redaction:
- `--redact` masks sensitive fields in outputs (reports/logs/CSV)

Summary:
- `--summary PATH|DIR` write a JSON summary file (single-file) or to a directory (batch)

### Target format (CSV)
Semicolon-separated (;) with this header:
```
Date;Withdrawals;Deposits;Payee;Description;Reference Number
```

Notes:
- Dates are output as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Amounts are decimals with a dot (e.g., `212.40`).
- `Payee` remains empty, `Description` defaults to `Transfer`, `Reference Number` contains the CRDB details/narration.

### Mapping configuration
Mapping kann die Auswahl der Eingabespalten steuern. Beispiel `mapping.json`:
```json
{
  "posting_date": ["Posting Date", "Transaction Date"],
  "details": ["Details", "Narration", "Description"],
  "debit": ["Debit", "Withdrawal"],
  "credit": ["Credit", "Deposit"]
}
```

Anmerkungen:
- Werte können String oder Liste sein. Die Suche vergleicht case-insensitive, zuerst exakt, dann als Teilstring. Fallback-Heuristik bleibt aktiv.
- CLI-Overrides (`--map-*`) haben Vorrang vor der Datei.

### Diagnostics und Validierung
Der Konverter sammelt Validierungs- und Parsing-Warnungen und protokolliert Beispiele. Bei `--strict` wird mit Fehler abgebrochen.

Mögliche Issues je Zeile (wichtig für den Report):
- `date_unparsed`: Datum konnte nicht geparst werden.
- `debit_unparsed`, `credit_unparsed`: Beträge nicht interpretierbar, obwohl Ziffern vorhanden.
- `both_amounts`: Debit und Credit gleichzeitig > 0.
- `negative_debit`, `negative_credit`: Negative Beträge erkannt.
- `date_missing_with_amount`: Betrag vorhanden, aber Datum leer.

Per-Row-Diagnose kann optional als CSV erzeugt werden (`--report`/`--report-dir`).

### Helper script (optional)
Shows header candidate(s) and sample rows from the XLS file – useful if the CRDB layout changes:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe _inspect_xls.py
```
```bash
python3 _inspect_xls.py
```

### Versioning
Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Update the version in `pyproject.toml` under `[project].version`.

Examples:
- Stable release: `0.2.0` → `0.2.1`
- Next minor: `0.2.1` → `0.3.0`
- Development pre-release (editable installs and packaging will expose this): `0.3.0.dev1`, `0.3.0a1`, `0.3.0b1`.

Check installed version:
```bash
crdb-convert --version
```

Release checklist:
- Bump `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml`
- Commit and tag (optional): `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`
- Reinstall if using editable: `pip install -e .`

Repository notes:
- The `files/` directory is added to `.gitignore` and not versioned.
- The `source/` and `converted/` directories are versioned but kept empty in a fresh clone via `.gitkeep` files. Output CSVs and logs will appear in `converted/` after running the converter.

    Durations are in milliseconds.

    All fields are optional. In particular, here is how the decoder
    reacts to missing values:

    - If ``frames`` list is present and contains more than one frame,
        a :class:`pyglet.image.Animation` is built. Otherwise, a single
        :class:`pyglet.image.AbstractImage` is returned. If the
        ``frames`` list is missing or empty, the same input ``sheet`` is
        returned (eventually its origin will be changed).
    - ``origin`` is used to set the origin (i.e. ``anchor_x``
        and ``anchor_y``) of all animation frames.
        The user is then encouraged to have an animation where all
        frames have the same size (or deal with the consequences).
        if and only if the ``frames`` list is missing or empty, the
        origin is set directly to the input image ``sheet``, which is
        then returned.
    - ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates (for frames, or for origin) are
        assumed to be ``0`` if unspecified.
    - ``w`` and ``h`` coordinates are assumed to be respectively equal
        to :attr:`sheet.width` and :attr:`sheet.height` if unspecified.
    - ``duration`` values are set to one second (``1000`` ms) if
        unspecified.

    Be aware that according to ``pyglet``'s coordinate system, the
    origin of an image is considered to be the bottom-left corner (
    as opposed to common top-left based systems).

    The format is compatible with `Aseprite <https://aseprite.com/>`_'s
    export spritesheet option (in the output tab, json data must be
    enabled and set to ``array`` type, not ``hash``). Keep in mind that
    Aseprite uses a top-left origin in its format. The format is
    enriched with various other properties which are ignored by this
    function.

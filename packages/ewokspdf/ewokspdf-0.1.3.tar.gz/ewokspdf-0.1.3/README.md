# ewokspdf

The **ewokspdf Project** is a Python library designed to provide Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis ewoks workflow tasks. 
The library is based on the calculations of [PDFgetX3](https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgetx.html) python API. The main tasks are: pattern averaging, `pdfgetx` configuration, `pdfgetx` processing and saving in box HDF5 and ASCII files.

## Installation

By default, at the ESRF, `ewokspdf` should be installed on `ewoks` workers with an Ansible script by the DAU team.

If you wish to install `ewokspdf` by yourself, youâ€™ll need Python 3.9+ and `pip`. You can install the library directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ewokspdf
```

Alternatively, to install from source, clone this repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.esrf.fr/workflow/ewoksapps/ewokspdf.git
cd ewokspdf
pip install -e .
```
`ewokspdf` has only two requirements: `ewoksxrpd` and `diffpy.pdfgetx`. `diffpy.pdgetx` can be downloaded [here](https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgetx.html). To install it you can run:

```bash
pip install ./diffpy.pdfgetx-VERSION.whl
```

So far, the diffpy version is 2.2.1 which supports python up to 3.10. The project is tested up to python 3.12 but the core would only work for pyton up to 3.10.

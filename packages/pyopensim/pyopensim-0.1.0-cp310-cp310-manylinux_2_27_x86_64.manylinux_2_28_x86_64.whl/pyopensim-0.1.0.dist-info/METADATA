# pyopensim

Portable Python bindings for [OpenSim](https://opensim.stanford.edu/) with comprehensive type hints.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyopensim.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyopensim)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Why pyopensim?

While the OpenSim team provides excellent [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim), pyopensim offers complementary benefits for specific use cases:

**PyPI Integration**: Available through standard `pip install` for seamless integration with PyPI-based workflows

**Enhanced IDE Support**: Comprehensive type hints (`.pyi` stubs) provide excellent autocomplete, type checking, and documentation in modern IDEs

**Wheel Distribution**: Self-contained wheels make it easy to bundle OpenSim with your applications without requiring users to manage conda environments

**Flexible Deployment**: Works well in environments where conda isn't preferred (Docker containers, serverless, CI/CD pipelines)


## Key Features

- **Portable**: Self-contained Python wheels with bundled OpenSim libraries
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive `.pyi` stub files for excellent IDE support and type checking
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows (work in progress), macOS, and Linux
- **Official Bindings**: Uses OpenSim's native SWIG bindings for full API compatibility
- **PyPI Ready**: Simple `pip install` - integrates with standard Python packaging


## Installation

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyopensim
```

No additional setup required! All OpenSim libraries are bundled in the wheel.

## Quick Start

```python
import pyopensim as osim

# Create a simple model
model = osim.Model()
model.setName("MyModel")

# Add a body
body = osim.Body("body", 1.0, osim.Vec3(0), osim.Inertia(1))
model.addComponent(body)

# Build and initialize
state = model.initSystem()
print(f"Model has {model.getNumBodies()} bodies")
```

## PyPI Distribution

pyopensim is automatically built and deployed to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyopensim/) using:

- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions CI/CD builds wheels for all platforms
- **cibuildwheel**: Ensures compatibility across Python versions and platforms  
- **Bundled Libraries**: All OpenSim dependencies are included in the wheels
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning aligned with OpenSim releases
- **Automated Tests**: Automated testing ensures each release works correctly

This provides an alternative distribution method that complements the official OpenSim library.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving type stubs, or enhancing documentation, your help is appreciated.

**[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Complete guide for contributors

**Key areas where you can help:**
- **Type Stub Improvements**: Enhance IDE support and type checking
- **Documentation**: Add examples and usage guides  
- **Testing**: Cross-platform validation and edge cases
- **Bug Reports**: Help us improve reliability

## Relationship to OpenSim

pyopensim is built on top of the official [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) project:

- **Same API**: Identical to the official OpenSim Python bindings
- **Same Functionality**: Full access to all OpenSim features and capabilities
- **Regular Updates**: Tracks OpenSim releases to provide latest features
- **Community Driven**: Developed by and for the OpenSim user community

For the official distribution, see the [opensim conda package](https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim).

## Development

This project builds OpenSim from source to create self-contained Python wheels:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neurobionics/pyopensim.git
cd pyopensim

# Build OpenSim and dependencies
make setup

# Build Python wheels
make build
```

The build process includes:
- Compiling OpenSim's C++ libraries and dependencies
- Generating SWIG Python bindings
- Creating comprehensive type stubs for IDE support
- Bundling everything into portable wheels

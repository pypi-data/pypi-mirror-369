## About

PICI stands for Partially Identifiable Causal Inference.
It is a causal inference package that can handle discrete Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models.

This project was based on the work of João Pedro Arroyo and João Gabriel Rodrigues on [GitHub](https://github.com/Causal-Inference-Group-C4AI/Linear-Programming-For-Interventional-Queries).


## Usage

### Install and import
- Install the package.
```bash
pip install pici
```

- Import the package.
```python
import pici
```

### Causal model creation

- Create a causal model:
```python
df = pd.read_csv(model_csv_path)
edges = "Z -> X, X -> Y, U1 -> X, U1 -> Y, U2 -> Z"
unobservable_variables = ["U1", "U2"]
custom_cardinalities = {"Z": 5, "X": 2, "Y": 16, "U1": 0, "U2": 0}
interventions=[('X',0)]
target=('Y',0)

model = pici.CausalModel(
  data=df,
  edges=edges,
  custom_cardinalities=custom_cardinalities,
  unobservables_labels=unobservable_variables,
  interventions=interventions,    # Optional in the model creation
  target=target,                  # Optional in the model creation
)
```

- You can set the target and interventions:
```python
model.set_interventions([('X', 1)])
model.set_target(('Y', 1))
```

### Interventional query

- You can make the query:
```python
model.intervention_query()
```

Or you can pass the target and interventions as arguments:

```python
model.intervention_query([('X', 1)], ('Y', 1))
```
- When `intervention_query` is called, it automatically checks if your query is identifiable or partially identifiable.
- If your query is **identifiable**, the return value is a `string`.

```python
exact_value = model.intervention_query()
```

- If your query is **partially identifiable**, the return value is a `tuple` of `strings`.
```python
lower_bound, upper_bound = model.intervention_query()
```

### Identifiability checker

- You can check if your intervention is identifiable by Backdoor criterion, Frontdoor criterion, or [ID algorithm](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-191.pdf):

```python
edges = "U1 -> X, U1 -> Y, X -> W, W -> Y, U2 -> W"
unobservables_labels=["U1", "U2"]

model = CausalModel(
    data=df,
    edges=edges,
    unobservables_labels=unobservables_labels
)

is_identifiable, identifiable_method, additional_detail = model.is_identifiable_intervention(
    interventions=[("X", 0)], target=("Y", 1)
)
```

### PN and PS approximations

- You can make PN and PS approximations, which we call *weak-pn* and *weak-ps*. These approximations are based on the paper **Probabilities of Causation and Root Cause Analysis with Quasi-Markovian Models** by Laurentino et al., 2025 (public link soon).

The same way as the `intervention_query`, if it's identifiable it will return a `string` otherwise a `tuple` of `strings`.

```python
pn_value = model.weak_pn_inference(intervention_label='X', target_label='Y')
ps_value = model.weak_ps_inference(intervention_label='X', target_label='Y')
```

## Theory behind

If you want to understand the theory behind our approach, you can read the paper [Arroyo et al., 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aUPT1kEiwP).


## Developer tools

All development tools are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).  
To get started, install Poetry by following the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), then activate the virtual environment.

### Install

- Install dependencies. Once you have installed Poetry, you can install the required packages:
```bash
poetry install
```


### Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

- Activate the Poetry virtual environment
```bash
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

- To exit the Poetry virtual environment, run:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Running Examples

Example:
```bash
python3 examples/example.py
```

- You also can run unit tests:
```bash
python3 tests/run_all_tests.py
```


### Linters

This project uses some linters to follow a code standardization that improves code consistency and cleanliness.

#### Ruff

This project uses **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** to remove unused imports and sort them.

Usage example for a file:

```bash
ruff check your_file.py --fix -s
```

For all files in the current directory and sub-directories:

```bash
ruff check . --fix -s
```

Running this command will make changes automatically.
We suggest using the flag `-s` to silence the numerous print logs.


#### Black

This project uses **[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** for automatic Python code formatting.
Black is a code formatter that ensures consistency by enforcing a uniform style.

Usage example for a file:

```bash
black your_file.py
```

For all files in the current directory and sub-directories:

```bash
black .
```

Running this command will change automatically.

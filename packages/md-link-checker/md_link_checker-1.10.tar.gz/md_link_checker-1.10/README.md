## MD-LINK-CHECKER - Utility to check url, section reference, and path links in Markdown files
[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/md-link-checker)](https://pypi.org/project/md-link-checker/)

This is a simple command line utility to check url, section reference, and path
links in Markdown files. It iterates through the specified Markdown files and
checks each link in the file for validity. If no file is specified then it
defaults to checking `README.md` in the current directory. URL network fetches
can be slow so they are checked simultaneously, doing a maximum 10 in parallel
(by default but you can change that using the `-p/--parallel-url-checks`
option). If you specify multiple files then all URLs across all files are
extracted at the start so only unique URLs are checked and network fetches are
minimised. There are a number of similar utilities available so why did I
create another one? Well, all those that I tried didn't work!

E.g. check links in the `README.md` file in the current directory:

```
$ cd /path/to/my/project
$ md-link-checker
```

Check links in all the `README.md` files across your projects:

```
$ cd ..
$ md-link-checker */README.md
```

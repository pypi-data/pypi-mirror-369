`keychecker` is a comprehensive key reconnaissance framework designed to facilitate the identification of potential usage locations and provide detailed insights into discovered keys during red team activities.

## üöÄ Features
* **Key Reconnaissance** - keychecker employs advanced scanning techniques to identify potential places where keys can be potentially used.
* **Detailed Key Insights** - keychecker goes beyond simple detection, providing in-depth information about the discovered keys, such as associated services, encryption algorithms, or any other information that can be fetched from the key.
* **Extensibility** - keychecker is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to easily integrate custom modules for tailored reconnaissance and analysis.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before installing keychecker, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
- **Python Version**: keychecker is compatible with Python 3.11 and above.
```bash
python --version
```

- **pip3 Version**: `pip` version should be comptaible with Python3.11. 

### Installation
To install the project use the `pip` utility
```bash
pip install keychecker
```

### Usage
To run keychecker in interactive mode, just run the following command - 
```bash
keychecker
```

It will also generate a command that you can run to automatically generate the same desired output.

To run the command with flags, run the following command -
```bash
$ keychecker --help

|   _      _ |_   _   _ |   _  ._
|< (/_ \/ (_ | | (/_ (_ |< (/_ | 
       /                         1.0.0 
---

usage: keychecker [-h] {identify,ssh} ...

Identifies the key and enumerates it for details.

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit

subcommands:
  {identify,ssh}  functionalities
    identify      Identify the type of key.
    ssh           Enumerate using SSH key.

For any issues/concerns reach out to keychecker@cyfinoid.com
```


## üåü Examples

```bash 
keychecker ssh --input /Users/molly/wild_keys/id_rsa --gitlab --bruteforce --wordlist /Users/molly/wordlist.txt
```

This command examines the SSH key located at `/Users/molly/wild_keys/id_rsa` for it's association with any user in `gitlab` platform and if any user is found then it will bruteforce the private repositories of the user based on the wordlist provided.


You can also take an interactive approach by simply typing:
```shell
keychecker
```
This command will prompt you with questions and guide you through the process to obtain the results.

## üß† Memory System

Claude Code remembers your project across sessions.

### What Gets Remembered
- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Code patterns** you've established
- **Design principles** your team follows
- **Debugging insights** and solutions
- **Refactoring outcomes** and lessons learned

### How It Works
1. **Automatic capture** - Insights stored as you work
2. **Cross-session persistence** - Knowledge survives restarts
3. **Team collaboration** - Shared memory via git
4. **Export/import** - Backup and restore insights

### Memory Types
- **`research_topic`** - Investigation findings
- **`architectural_decision`** - Design choices and trade-offs
- **`design_pattern`** - Code patterns and their usage
- **`principle_violation`** - Issues found and fixes applied
- **`tagging_decision`** - Release management decisions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Integration

Automatic best practices for your tech stack.

### Supported Technologies
| Technology | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **Python** | uv workflows, testing with pytest, modern Python patterns |
| **Rust** | Cargo workflows, error handling, async patterns |
| **JavaScript/TypeScript** | npm/yarn workflows, testing, modern JS patterns |
| **Java** | Maven/Gradle, Spring Boot, testing patterns |
| **Kotlin** | Backend development, coroutines, Spring integration |
| **Ruby** | Bundler workflows, Rails patterns, testing |
| **C#/.NET** | dotnet CLI, ASP.NET Core, testing patterns |
| **C++** | Modern C++20 features, CMake, testing |
| **Docker** | Container best practices, security, optimization |

### How It Works
- **Automatic detection** - Scans your project for technology indicators
- **Best practices** - Loads appropriate guidelines and patterns
- **Tool integration** - Works with your existing toolchain
- **Agent specialization** - Agents understand your tech stack

## üéØ Context-Clean Task Management

Intelligent task coordination through specialized agents that keep your main context clean and focused.

### Agent-Based Task Orchestration
- **Delegated task management** - Agents handle complex multi-step workflows independently
- **Clean main context** - No polluting TODO lists in your primary workspace
- **Intelligent coordination** - Agents automatically break down complex requests
- **Context preservation** - Task progress stored in persistent memory

### How It Works
- **Automatic detection** - System recognizes when tasks need structured coordination
- **Agent delegation** - Complex workflows handed off to specialized task agents
- **Memory integration** - Progress and context preserved across sessions
- **Clean handoffs** - Agents return concise results without cluttering main context

### Benefits
- **Focused conversations** - Main context stays clean and on-topic
- **Comprehensive execution** - Nothing gets overlooked through agent coordination
- **Persistent progress** - Work continues seamlessly across sessions

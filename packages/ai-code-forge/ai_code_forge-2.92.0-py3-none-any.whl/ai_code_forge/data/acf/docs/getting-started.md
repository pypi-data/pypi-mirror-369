# Getting Started with Claude Code Template

## Overview

This template transforms your Claude Code experience into a comprehensive AI-powered development environment. These files provide detailed guidelines and best practices that complement the AI operational instructions in CLAUDE.md, designed for both human reference and AI processing.

## What This Does

Transform your Claude Code experience with:
- ‚úÖ **17 AI agents** with mandatory coordination (minimum 3+ agents for complex tasks)
- ‚úÖ **Context-clean workflows** - Agents handle complex tasks independently, keeping conversations focused
- ‚úÖ **Custom slash commands** like `/review`, `/test`, `/refactor` for instant help
- ‚úÖ **Technology-specific guidance** - Python, Rust, Java, JavaScript, and more
- ‚úÖ **Persistent memory** - Claude remembers your project decisions across sessions
- ‚úÖ **Automatic documentation** - Updates docs with every code change
- ‚úÖ **Automatic setup** - One-time install, works in every project

## Purpose

This template helps developers understand:

1. **Decision-making criteria** - When and why to create certain components
2. **Best practice patterns** - Proven approaches for common development scenarios
3. **Process workflows** - Step-by-step procedures for project maintenance
4. **Quality standards** - Metrics and validation approaches for project health

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended)
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ondrasek/ai-code-forge.git`
2. Copy configuration: `cp -r .claude/ ~/.claude/`
3. Set API key: `echo 'export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-key"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`
4. Test: Open Claude Code and try `/review`

**üìñ Detailed Instructions**: See [Configuration Reference](configuration-reference.md) for complete setup details

### Option 2: GitHub Dotfiles (For GitHub Codespaces)
1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/ondrasek/ai-code-forge/fork) and rename it to `dotfiles`
2. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Codespaces ‚Üí Dotfiles ‚Üí Enable
3. Open any project in Claude Code - you now have superpowers! ‚ú®

**Try immediately:**
```
/review          # Get comprehensive code feedback
/agents-guide     # Explore your AI helpers
/discuss         # Challenge your architectural ideas
```

## What You Get

### Essential AI Agents (Mandatory Baseline)
- **`researcher`** - Find answers and current best practices
- **`patterns`** - Spot code problems and suggest improvements
- **`critic`** - Get honest feedback on your ideas and decisions

**Note**: These 3 agents are automatically used together for all non-trivial requests as part of the mandatory coordination protocol.

### Advanced AI Agents

- `git-tagger` - Automatic release management
- `git-troubleshooter` - Git error diagnosis and resolution

</details>

### Custom Commands
- `/review` - Comprehensive code review
- `/test` - Testing assistance and generation
- `/refactor` - Code improvement suggestions

## When to Use This Guide

Consult these resources when:

- Planning new features or architectural changes
- Setting up development workflows
- Understanding project conventions and standards
- Training new team members on project practices
- Debugging complex issues or performance problems
- Making architectural decisions with AI assistance

These docs are maintained alongside code changes to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Real-World Examples

**Note**: All examples automatically include the mandatory baseline agents (researcher + patterns + critic) plus any additional specialized agents.

### Debugging a Complex Bug
```
1. /discuss "Should I rewrite this authentication module?"
2. System automatically uses: researcher + patterns + critic + hypothesis
3. /test to generate test cases that isolate the problem
```

### Architecture Review
```
1. /review to get comprehensive feedback on your code
2. System automatically uses: researcher + patterns + critic + principles
3. Documentation automatically updated with architectural decisions
```

### New Feature Planning
```
1. Use explorer agent for multiple approaches (includes baseline agents)
2. Use constraints agent to handle competing requirements
3. /discuss the trade-offs before implementing
4. Documentation automatically updated when feature is implemented
```

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not working?**
- Make sure you're in a Claude Code session
- Check that the template was installed correctly with `ls .claude/`

**Agents not responding as expected?**
- Try being more specific about what you want
- Use `/agents-guide` to see what each agent does best

**Memory not persisting?**
- Memory is handled by Claude Code's built-in MCP memory server
- No additional setup required for basic memory functionality

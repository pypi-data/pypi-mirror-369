# nblite

> A lightweight wrapper around [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev) for streamlined notebook-driven development


nblite simplifies the workflow between Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and module code, enhancing the notebook-driven development process.

**Note:** `nblite` is merely a wrapper around [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev) with some adjustments and additions adapted to the needs of the [Autonomy Data Unit](https://adu.autonomy.work/). Full credit of the concept and implementation of notebook-driven development using Jupyter notebooks should go to the creators of [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev).

## Core Concepts

### Code locations
Directories containing code in different formats (notebooks, scripts, modules). Each code location is defined in the `nblite.toml` configuration file and will store different representations of your code. Available formats are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Format</th>
            <th>Format key</th>
            <th>File Extension</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Python module</td>
            <td><code>module</code></code></td>
            <td><code>py</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jupyter notebook</td>
            <td><code>ipynb</code></td>
            <td><code>ipynb</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/demo/World%20population.pct.py">Percent</a></td>
            <td><code>percent</code></td>
            <td><code>pct.py</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/demo/World%20population.lgt.py">Light</a></td>
            <td><code>light</code></td>
            <td><code>lgt.py</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/demo/World%20population.spx.py">Sphinx</a>
            </td>
            <td><code>sphinx</code></td>
            <td><code>spx.py</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/demo/World%20population.myst.md">Myst</a></td>
            <td><code>myst</code></td>
            <td><code>myst.md</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/demo/World%20population.pandoc.md">Pandoc</a></td>
            <td><code>pandoc</code></td>
            <td><code>pandoc.md</code></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


In the `nblite.toml` you define the code locations and the formats of the code within them:

```toml
[cl.nbs]
format="ipynb"
path="notebooks"

[cl.pts]
format="percent"
path="percent_notebooks"

[cl.lib]
format="module"
path="nblite"
```

Here we have defined three code locations (`nbs`, `pts` and `lib`) and specified their paths (relative to the project root) and their formats. Read more about plaintext notebook formats [here](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats-scripts.html#the-percent-format).

### Export pipeline
Defines the flow of code conversion between different code locations. For example, a typical pipeline might be:
```
nbs -> pts
pts -> lib
```
This means:
1. Start with notebooks (`.ipynb`) as the source
2. Convert them to percent scripts (`.pct.py`)
3. Finally export to Python library modules (`.py`)

### Notebook 'twins'

Corresponding versions of the same content in different formats. When you write a notebook `my_notebook.ipynb`, nblite can create twins like:
- `my_notebook.pct.py` (percent script)
- `my_notebook.lgt.py` (light script)
- `my_module/my_notebook.py` (Python module)

These twins contain the same logical content but in different formats, allowing you to use the format that's most appropriate for the task at hand.

### Why store plaintext versions?

While Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) are excellent for interactive development, they pose challenges for version control systems like Git:

1. **Git-Friendly**: Plaintext formats (`.pct.py`, `.lgt.py`, `.py`) are better handled by Git, making diffs and merge conflicts easier to resolve.
2. **GitHub UI**: GitHub's interface more effectively displays changes in plaintext Python files compared to JSON-formatted notebook files.
3. **Code Review**: Reviewing code changes is more straightforward with plaintext formats.
4. **Cleaner History**: By cleaning notebook outputs before committing, you avoid polluting your Git history with large output cells and changing execution counts.
5. **Collaboration**: Team members can work with the format they preferâ€”notebooks for exploration, Python files for implementation.

The export pipeline ensures that changes made in one format are propagated to all twins, maintaining consistency across representations.

## Key Features

- **Export Pipeline**: Convert notebooks between different formats (.ipynb, percent scripts, light scripts, and Python modules)
- **Documentation**: Generate documentation from notebooks using Quarto
- **Git Integration**: Clean notebooks and enforce consistent git commits
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute notebooks in parallel for faster workflow
- **Export as Functions**: Notebooks can be exported as functions

## Quick Start

### Initialize a project

```bash
# Create a new nblite project
nbl init --module-name my_project
```

### Set up Git hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks for automatic notebook cleaning
nbl install-hooks
```

Git hooks ensure that notebooks are properly cleaned before committing. The pre-commit hook automatically:
- Validates that notebooks are clean (removes metadata and outputs)
- Ensures that all notebook twins are consistent
- Prevents accidental commits of unclean notebooks

### Create a new notebook

```bash
# Create a new notebook in a code location
nbl new nbs/my_notebook.ipynb
```

### Fill Notebooks with Outputs

The `nbl fill` command is used to execute all the cells in all `.ipynb` notebooks.
 
```bash
nbl fill
```

This command also works as a testing command.

### Prepare your project

```bash
# Export, clean, and fill notebooks in one command
nbl prepare
```

## Configuration

nblite uses a TOML configuration file (`nblite.toml`) at the project root:

```toml
export_pipeline = """
nbs -> pts
pts -> lib
"""
docs_cl = "nbs"
docs_title = "My Project"

[cl.lib]
path = "my_module"
format = "module"

[cl.nbs]
format = "ipynb"

[cl.pts]
format = "percent"
```
<!-- #endregion -->

## Common Commands

Run `nbl` to see all available commands.

### Export and Conversion

- `nbl export`: Export notebooks according to the export pipeline
- `nbl convert <nb_path> <dest_path>`: Convert a notebook between formats
- `nbl clear`: Clear downstream code locations

### Notebook Management

- `nbl clean`: Clean notebooks by removing outputs and metadata
- `nbl fill`: Execute notebooks and fill with outputs
- `nbl test`: Test that notebooks execute without errors (dry run of fill)

### Documentation

- `nbl readme`: Generate README.md from index.ipynb
- `nbl render-docs`: Render project documentation using Quarto
- `nbl preview-docs`: Preview documentation 

### Git Integration

- `nbl git-add`: Add files to git staging with proper cleaning
- `nbl validate-staging`: Validate that staged notebooks are clean
- `nbl install-hooks`: Install git hooks for the project

## Development Workflow

1. Write code in Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
2. Run `nbl export` to convert to other formats
3. Run `nbl clean` before committing to git
4. Use `nbl fill` (or `nbl test` if outputs are not to be rendered) to verify your notebooks execute correctly
5. Use `nbl render-docs` to generate documentation, or use `nbl preview-docs` to preview the documentation.

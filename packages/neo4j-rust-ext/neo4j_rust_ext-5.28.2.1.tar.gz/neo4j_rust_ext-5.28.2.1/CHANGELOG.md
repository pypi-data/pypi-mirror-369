## [5.28.2.1](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/tree/5.28.2.1) (2025-08-15)
***
### **üîßÔ∏è Fixes**
* Fix decoding of map keys of certain sizes ([#59]).

[#59]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/59


## [5.28.2.0](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/tree/5.28.2.0) (2025-07-30)
***
### **‚≠êÔ∏è New Features**
* Target driver version 5.28.2 ([#54]).

[#54]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/54

### **üëèÔ∏è Improvements**
* Update dependencies ([#32]):  
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è Bump minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) from `1.67` to `1.77`.
  * Security fix by bumping PyO3 (Rust binding for Python) from `0.22.4` to `0.24.2`.
  * Update `maturin` (Python package builder) from `~= 1.6.0` to `~= 1.8.3`.
* Harden `Structure` class against memory leak ([#53]).  
  The extensions' implementation of packstream `Structure` could leak memory when being part of a reference cycle.
  In reality this doesn't matter because the driver never constructs cyclic `Structure`s.
  Every packstream value is a tree in terms of references (both directions: packing and unpacking).  
  This change is meant to harden the extensions against introducing effective memory leaks in the driver should the driver's usage of `Structure` change in the future.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Change licensing from "Apache-2.0" to "Apache-2.0 AND MIT"  ([#43]).
* Update licensing meta data to be PEP 639 compliant ([#41]).  
  * Update `maturin` (Python package builder) from `~= 1.8.3` to `~= 1.9.0`.
* Update `maturin` (Python package builder) from `~= 1.9.0` to `~= 1.9.1` ([#54]).

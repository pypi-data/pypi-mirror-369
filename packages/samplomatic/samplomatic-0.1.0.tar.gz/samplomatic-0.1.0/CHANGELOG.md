## [0.1.0](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/tree/0.1.0) - 2025-08-15

### Added

- Initial population of the library with features, including:
   - transpiler passes to aid in the boxing of circuits with annotations
   - the `samplomatic.Samplex` object and all necessary infrastructure to
     describe certain types of basic Pauli randomization and noise injection
   - certain but not comprehensive support for dynamic circuits
   - the `build()` method for interpretting boxed-up circuits into template/samplex pairs ([#38](https://github.com/Qiskit/samplomatic/issues/38))

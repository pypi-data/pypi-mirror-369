def mask_near_points(xgrid, ygrid, xpoints, ypoints, threshold=None):
    """
    Generate a boolean mask for a 2D grid, where True means the grid cell is close to at least one (xpoint, ypoint).

    Parameters
    ----------
    xgrid : 1D array
        Grid coordinates along the x-axis (must be monotonically increasing).
    ygrid : 1D array
        Grid coordinates along the y-axis (must be monotonically increasing).
    xpoints : 1D array
        X-coordinates of the data points.
    ypoints : 1D array
        Y-coordinates of the data points.
    threshold : float, optional
        Maximum distance from a grid cell center to be considered "near" a data point.
        If None, uses 1.5 Ã— max(mean grid spacing in x and y).

    Returns
    -------
    mask : 2D boolean array
        Mask array with shape (len(ygrid), len(xgrid)), where True means "keep" (near a point).

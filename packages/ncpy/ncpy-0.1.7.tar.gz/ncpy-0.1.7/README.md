**ncpy** — Numerical Computing in Python.

`ncpy` is a compact, educational Python library that implements common numerical methods for courses, assignments, and quick prototyping.  
Built on **NumPy** and (optionally) **SciPy**, it offers easy-to-use functions for:

- Root finding  
- Interpolation  
- Curve fitting / Approximation  
- Numerical integration  
- Numerical differentiation  
- Solving linear systems

## Example

- Root finding - Newton Raphson
---
from ncpy import newton_raphson

f = lambda x: x**2 - 2
df = lambda x: 2*x

root = newton_raphson(f, df, x0=1.0)
print("Root:", root)  # ~1.4142

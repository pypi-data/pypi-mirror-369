"""Low-level implementation of the Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fitter.

This module contains the core, performance-critical functions for the
Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) tailored to the DFMI signal model. The
functions are heavily optimized using NumPy vectorization to avoid slow Python
loops and achieve high throughput.

The main entry point is the `fit()` function, which orchestrates the LMA loop
and includes robust fallback mechanisms for improved convergence.

Constants
---------
NPARMS : int
    The total number of parameters in the full DFMI model (amp, m, phi, psi).
MAX_LMA_STEPS : int
    The maximum number of iterations for the Levenberg-Marquardt loop.
LMA_CONVERGENCE_IMPROVE : float
    The minimum relative improvement in Sum-of-Squares (SSQ) required to
    continue the LMA loop.
LMA_CONVERGENCE_PARAM_CHANGE : float
    The minimum relative change in the parameter vector norm required to
    continue the LMA loop.
FITOK_THRESHOLD : float
    An SSQ value below which a fit is considered "good", skipping
    the retry mechanism.

    The Jacobian describes the sensitivity of the model's outputs (the I/Q
    values of each harmonic) to changes in its input parameters. It is a
    matrix of shape `(2 * n_harmonics, 4)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_harmonics : int
        The number of harmonics (from 1 to n_harmonics) to include in the model.
    param : np.ndarray
        A 4-element array containing the model parameters: `[amp, m, phi, psi]`.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The Jacobian matrix `J`, where `J[i, j]` is the partial derivative of
        the i-th model output with respect to the j-th parameter. The first
        `n_harmonics` rows correspond to the Q components, and the next `n_harmonics` rows

def calculate_m_precision(m_range: np.ndarray, n_harmonics: int, snr_db: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """Calculates the statistical uncertainty of the 'm' parameter.

    This function computes the theoretical precision (standard deviation) with
    which the modulation depth `m` can be estimated, based on the Cramer-Rao
    Lower Bound (CRLB). It assumes an idealized NLS fit where noise on the
    I/Q measurements is the only source of error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m_range : np.ndarray
        An array of modulation depth `m` values (in radians) to analyze.
    n_harmonics : int
        The number of harmonics to use in the fit.
    snr_db : float
        The Signal-to-Noise Ratio in dB for the I/Q measurements. This SNR
        is defined relative to the signal amplitude `amp=1`.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        An array of the calculated statistical uncertainty (delta_m), with
        the same shape as `m_range`. Values will be `np.inf` if the
        calculation fails (e.g., due to a singular matrix).

    Notes
    -----
    The calculation relies on the Fisher Information Matrix, which is
    approximated by `J^T * J`. The covariance matrix of the estimated
    parameters is the inverse of the Fisher matrix, scaled by the noise
    variance. The uncertainty in `m` is the square root of the corresponding
    diagonal element of the covariance matrix.

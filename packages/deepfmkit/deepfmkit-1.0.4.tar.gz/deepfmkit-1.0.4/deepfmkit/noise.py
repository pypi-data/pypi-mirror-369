"""Ultra-fast Python noise generators for 1/f^alpha noise.

This module provides classes for generating white, red (Brownian), and general
colored (1/f^alpha) noise time-series. The core generation method for colored
noise follows the numerically stable approach of using a cascade of first-order
IIR filters to shape white noise, as described by Plaszczynski.

This implementation is highly optimized for performance and stability:
1.  **Numba-JIT Acceleration**: The core filter cascade loop in `alpha_noise`
    is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled by Numba, providing C-like execution speed.
2.  **Buffered Sampling**: A `get_sample()` method with an internal buffer
    amortizes the cost of generation, allowing for efficient single-sample
    retrieval in state-space models like Kalman filters.
3.  **Vectorized Initialization**: NumPy vectorization is used to rapidly
    calculate filter coefficients during class initialization.
4.  **Modular Class Structure**: A base class shares common logic, improving
    maintainability and reducing code duplication.

Requires the `numba` library (`pip install numba`).

"""Factories for generating physics configurations in high-throughput experiments.

This module provides classes that follow the Factory software pattern. The
primary purpose is to encapsulate user-defined logic for creating physics
configurations (`LaserConfig`, `IfoConfig`) in a way that is "pickleable"
and thus safe for use with Python's `multiprocessing` library.

Users should create a subclass of `ExperimentFactory` and implement the
`__call__` method to define the logic for a single experimental trial. This
provides a robust and portable way to define complex experiments.

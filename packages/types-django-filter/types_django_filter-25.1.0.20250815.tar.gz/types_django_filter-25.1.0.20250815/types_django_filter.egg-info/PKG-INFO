## Typing stubs for django-filter

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) type stub package for
the [`django-filter`](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `django-filter`. This version of
`types-django-filter` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`django-filter==25.1.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/django-filter`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/django-filter)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.16.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.403

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`893b9a760deb3be64d13c748318e95a752230961`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/893b9a760deb3be64d13c748318e95a752230961).

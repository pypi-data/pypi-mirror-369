## Overview

ALomnacy is a Python framework for running active learning (AL) workflows for training machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs). This package focuses on customization and reproducibility to build robust training datasets and train MLIPs.

## Key Features

- ðŸš€ **Automated AL Workflows**: End-to-end active learning with minimal manual intervention
- ðŸ”§ **HPC Integration**: Built-in support for remote job submission on HPC clusters
- âš¡ **Parallelization**: Ensures that jobs run concurrently where possible
- ðŸ”„ **Extensible Design**: Abstract base classes for easy customization and extension
- ðŸ“Š **Analysis Tools**: Built-in utilities for monitoring and analyzing AL progress

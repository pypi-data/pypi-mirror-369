"""Tag-based tool search strategy implementation.

This module provides a search strategy that ranks tools based on tag matches
and description keyword matches. It implements a weighted scoring system where
explicit tag matches receive higher scores than description word matches.

    Implements a weighted scoring algorithm that matches search queries against

    description word matches receive reduced weight.

    Scoring Algorithm:
        - Exact tag matches: Weight 1.0
        - Tag word matches: Weight equal to description_weight
        - Description word matches: Weight equal to description_weight
        - Only considers description words longer than 2 characters

    Examples:
        >>> strategy = TagSearchStrategy(repository, description_weight=0.3)
        >>> tools = await strategy.search_tools("weather api", limit=5)
        >>> # Returns tools with "weather" or "api" tags/descriptions

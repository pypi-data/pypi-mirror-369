"""Abstract interface for tool and provider storage.

This module defines the contract for implementing tool repositories that store
and manage UTCP tools and their associated providers. Different implementations
can provide various storage backends such as in-memory, database, or file-based
storage.

    """Abstract interface for tool and provider storage implementations.

    Defines the contract for repositories that manage the lifecycle and storage
    of UTCP tools and providers. Repositories are responsible for:
    - Persisting provider configurations and their associated tools
    - Providing efficient lookup and retrieval operations
    - Managing relationships between providers and tools
    - Ensuring data consistency during operations

    The repository interface supports both individual and bulk operations,
    allowing for flexible implementation strategies ranging from simple
    in-memory storage to sophisticated database backends.

    Note:
        All methods are async to support both synchronous and asynchronous
        storage implementations.

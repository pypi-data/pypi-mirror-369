"""Configuration models for UTCP client setup.

This module defines the configuration classes and variable loading mechanisms
for UTCP clients. It provides flexible variable substitution support through
multiple sources including environment files, direct configuration, and
custom variable loaders.

The configuration system enables:
    - Variable substitution in provider configurations
    - Multiple variable sources with hierarchical resolution
    - Environment file loading (.env files)
    - Direct variable specification
    - Custom variable loader implementations

    Mean-line design
    ================

    The first step in turbomachinery design is a one-dimensional analysis along
    a representative 'mean-line', a simplified model of the true
    three-dimensional flow. We consider an axisymmetric streamsurface at an
    intermediate position between hub and casing, with stations at the
    inlet and exit of each blade row.

    The inputs to the mean-line design are the inlet condition and the machine duty.
    Specifying some aerodynamic design variables and applying conservation of
    mass, momentum and energy, we can calculate the outputs of
    annulus areas, mean radii and flow angles at each station.

    The mean-line design process is different for each machine architecture:
    compressor/turbine, axial/radial, and so on. :program:`turbigen` provides
    the built-in architectures listed below, and also allows considerable flexibility
    in defining your own :ref:`ml-custom`.

    .. _ml-custom:

    Custom architectures
    --------------------

    Custom architectures are defined by subclassing the :class:`MeanLineDesigner`.
    First, set the user plugin directory in the configuration file, e.g. to a
    new folder called `plug` in the current directory by adding the following
    line:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        plugdir: ./plug

    Then, create a new Python file in the `plug` directory, e.g.
    `custom.py`, and define a new class that inherits from
    :class:`MeanLineDesigner` like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        # File: ./plug/custom.py

        import turbigen.meanline

        class MyCustomMeanLine(turbigen.meanline.MeanLineDesigner):

                }

    You will need to implement two static methods: `forward()` and `backward()`.

    The `forward()` function takes as arguments an inlet state object and
    some duty, geometric, or aerodynamic design variables. This function
    returns all information required to lay out the mean-line: radii, annulus
    areas, angular velocities, velocity components, and thermodynamic states at
    the inlet and exit of each blade row.

    The entries in the `mean_line` part of the configuration file are fed into
    `forward()` as keyword arguments. For example, if the configuration file
    contains:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        mean_line:
            type: my_custom_mean_line
            phi: 0.8
            psi: 1.6
            Ma1: 0.5

    Then, within :program:`turbigen`, the `type` key identifies
    the `MyCustomMeanLine` class and calls its `forward()` method like:

    .. code-block:: python

        MyCustomMeanLine.forward(
            So1,  # Inlet state calculated elsewhere, positional arg
            phi=0.8, # Keys from `mean_line` config unpacked as kwargs
            psi=1.6,
            Ma1=0.5,
        )

    Some notes on implementing the `forward()` method:

    * Retain generality of the working fluid by using the set property methods
      of the `Fluid` class, as in the example above. This is preferable to
      hard-coding calculations assuming a specific equation of state such as
      ideal gas.
    * Specify aerodynamic design variables instead of geometric ones, e.g.
      flow coefficient and Mach number instead of shaft
      angular velocity and radius ratio. Constraining geometry can lead to
      feasible designs only over a narrow range of duty, with many infeasible
      designs with no solution to the mean-line equations. It is more
      straighforward to map out a design space by varying independent variables
      within their natural aerodynamic bounds.
    * Controlling Mach number prevents choking when moving around the
      design space. It is imperative to limit deceleration through compressors
      to avoid flow separation, so specifying a relative velocity ratio or de
      Haller number is a good idea. Letting meridional velocity float can lead
      to wide variations in span and hence unfavourable high-curvature annulus
      lines, so controlling the change in meridional velocity through the
      machine is advisable.
    * Loss is best handled by guessing a vector of entropy rise at each
      station, which does not depend on the frame of reference. The values can then be
      updated using CFD results.
    * Iteration is required to solve for density in compressible cases. It is
      often easiest to guess a value for the blade speed, then iterate to converge
      on a blade speed that satisfies the requested duty. Matching a
      total-to-static pressure ratio requires iteration because the exit
      dynamic head is not known a priori.

    The `backward()` function takes a mean-line flow field as its only
    argument, and calculates a dictionary of the arguments to `forward()`.
    Given a suitably averaged CFD solution, `backward()` is a post-processing
    step that allows comparison of the three-dimensional simulated flow field
    to the one-dimensional design intent. Also, feeding the output of
    `forward()` straight into `backward()` acts as a check that the mean-line
    design is consistent with the requested inputs. `backward()` can also be
    used to post-process other quantities of interest from the mixed-out CFD
    flow field. Extra keys are printed the log file and saved to the output configuration
    file; only keys that are also design variables will be fed back
    into `forward()` for the consistency check.

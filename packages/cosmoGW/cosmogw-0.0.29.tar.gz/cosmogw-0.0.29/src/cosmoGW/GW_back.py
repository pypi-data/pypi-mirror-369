    Main reference here is Maggiore:1999vm, eq. 17:

    OmGW(f) = (2 pi^2)/(3 H0^2) f^2 hc^2 (f).

    hc2 (f) is then defined as the spectrum in log(f) of h+^2 + hx^2 and
    Maggiore defines Sh(f) in eq. B12 such that hc^2 (f) = 2 f Sh_Mag (f).

    Note that this is different than the notation in  RoperPol:2021xnd,
    eq. B.18, used in interferometry.py, where hc^2 (f) = f Sh^pm (f),
    such that this is

    Sh^pm (f) = 2 Sh_Mag (f).

    Hence, from hc^2 (f) we can compute Sh_Mag (f) = hc^2 (f)/2f and
    Sh^pm (f) = hc^2 (f)/f.

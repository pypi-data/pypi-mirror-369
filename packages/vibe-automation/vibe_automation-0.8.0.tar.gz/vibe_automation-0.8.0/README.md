# Vibe Automation SDK

## Usage

### ActIO subtask model

Use `VA_ENABLE_SUBTASK_AGENT` flag to enable all `page.act` calls to use ActIO model.
The support for `page.step` is coming later.

```bash
VA_ENABLE_SUBTASK_AGENT=true uv run python examples/act.py
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python >=3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. Install uv if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Add protos for `orby/va/public`:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.generate_protos
```

### Running Examples

```bash
uv run python examples/form.py
```

## Version Management & Releases

Use the release script for a streamlined release process:

```bash
# Test what would happen (dry-run)
./release.sh patch --dry-run

# Create a patch release (bug fixes)
./release.sh patch

# Create a minor release (new features, backward compatible)
./release.sh minor

# Create a major release (breaking changes)
./release.sh major
```

The release script automatically:

1. Ensures you're on the main branch with latest changes
2. Bumps version in all files (`pyproject.toml`, `.bumpversion.toml`)
3. Creates a git commit with the version change
4. Creates a release branch (`release/v{version}`)
5. Creates a pull request

### Release Workflow

The release process kicks off when the previous PR is merged. A first GitHub action creates a tag (`release/v{version}`) which in turn triggers a second Github action to:

- Creates a GitHub release with auto-generated release notes
- Builds the package using `uv build`
- Publishes to PyPI using OpenID Connect (trusted publishing)

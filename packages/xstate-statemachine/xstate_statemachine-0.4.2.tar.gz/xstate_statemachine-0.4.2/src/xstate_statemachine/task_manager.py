# 🗂️ Asynchronous Task Manager
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module provides the `TaskManager` class, a specialized utility for
# organizing and managing the lifecycle of `asyncio.Task` objects. These tasks
# are typically created for background operations like `after` timers and
# `invoke`d services.
#
# This class is crucial for preventing resource leaks. By associating each task
# with an "owner" (typically a state ID), it can cleanly cancel all related
# background operations when a state is exited, ensuring no orphaned tasks are
# left running. This encapsulation of task lifecycle management is a key aspect
# of the library's robustness in an asynchronous environment.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Provides a manager for asyncio tasks associated with state machine states.

This utility is essential for the asynchronous `Interpreter` to safely manage
the lifecycle of background processes.

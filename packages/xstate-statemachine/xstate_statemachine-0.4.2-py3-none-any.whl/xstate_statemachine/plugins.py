# 🔌 Plugin System (Observer Pattern)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module defines the base class for plugins, which allows for extending
# the interpreter's functionality using the "Observer" design pattern. This
# architecture provides a clean separation of concerns where cross-cutting
# logic like logging, debugging, or persistence can be added without modifying
# the core interpreter code.
#
# This design makes the system highly extensible and maintainable, allowing
# developers to "observe" the state machine's lifecycle and react accordingly.
# It is a cornerstone of the library's flexibility.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""Provides an extensible plugin system for the state machine interpreter.

This module contains the `PluginBase` abstract class, which defines the
interface for creating new plugins, and `LoggingInspector`, a powerful,
built-in plugin for debugging state machine execution.

    Plugins hook into the interpreter's lifecycle to add features like logging,
    debugging, or persistence. This class implements the "Observer" design
    pattern, where each method represents a different event in the interpreter's
    lifecycle that can be "observed."

    Subclasses should override the methods they are interested in. This class
    is generic, enabling plugins to be type-safe with the specific interpreter
    they are designed to work with.

# üîå Plugin System (Observer Pattern)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module defines the base class for plugins, which allows for extending
# the interpreter's functionality using the "Observer" design pattern. This
# architecture provides a clean separation of concerns where cross-cutting
# logic like logging, debugging, or persistence can be added without modifying
# the core interpreter code.
#
# This design makes the system highly extensible and maintainable, allowing
# developers to "observe" the state machine's lifecycle and react accordingly.
# It is a cornerstone of the library's flexibility.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""Provides an extensible plugin system for the state machine interpreter.

This module contains the `PluginBase` abstract class, which defines the
interface for creating new plugins, and `LoggingInspector`, a powerful,
built-in plugin for debugging state machine execution.

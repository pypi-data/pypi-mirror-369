# 🚨 Custom Exception Hierarchy
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module defines a set of custom exceptions for the state machine library.
# Having a specific exception hierarchy, with a clear base class, allows for
# more precise error handling and makes the library's failure modes more
# transparent and predictable for developers.
#
# This approach follows best practices by providing a single, catchable base
# exception (`XStateMachineError`) while also offering granular error types
# for more specific handling, improving the robustness and usability of the
# library.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Defines a clear and specific exception hierarchy for the state machine library.

This allows consumers of the library to write robust error-handling logic.

Example:
    A demonstration of catching a specific vs. a general library error.

    >>> from xstate_statemachine import XStateMachineError, StateNotFoundError
    >>>
    >>> def run_some_machine_logic(should_succeed):
    ...     if not should_succeed:
    ...         # In a real scenario, the library would raise this internally.
    ...         raise StateNotFoundError(target="some.missing.state")
    ...     return "✅ Success"
    ...
    >>> try:
    ...     run_some_machine_logic(should_succeed=False)
    ... except StateNotFoundError as e:
    ...     # Handle a specific, recoverable error
    ...     print(f"Caught a specific error: {e}")
    ... except XStateMachineError:
    ...     # Handle any other library-specific error
    ...     print("Caught a general state machine error.")
    Caught a specific error: Could not find state with ID 'some.missing.state'.

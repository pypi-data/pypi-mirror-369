                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU Lesser General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its
users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.
You can use this license for your programs too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of
use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software
or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can
do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying
you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore,
you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library,
you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that
they can relink them with the library after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for the free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence
of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining
a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist
that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must
be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or
using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally
viewed as a combined work, a derivative of the original library.
The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because
it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
General Public License. It also provides other free software
developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license
provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large
body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C
Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the
whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux
operating system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of
the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
executables that are changed versions of the library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
                  AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Library a copy of this License
along with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
  of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
  the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who
  wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
  these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is legally governed by
  the ordinary GNU General Public License and all its terms, instead
  of by the Lesser General Public License and its terms.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
  of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
  the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
  be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
  code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
  along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
  or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
  it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses
  the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be
  allowed to be distributed under terms of your choice, provided that
  you also do each of the following:

    a) The header files with the library must be distributed with the
    work.

    b) The object code for the work may be linked with the library.

    c) The work must not be a derivative work of the library.

    d) The work must be distributed in such a way that recipients can
    re-link it with the library after making changes to the library.

  A "header file" is a file containing C declarations and macro
  definitions to be used with C source files.  The "Corresponding
  Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code
  needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
  object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
  those activities. However, it does not include the work's system
  libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
  but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
  Source includes interface definition files associated with source
  files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and
  dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
  designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
  control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  6. You may copy and distribute the executable form of the Library
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
  one of the following:

    a) Accompany the executable with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
    software interchange.

    b) Accompany the executable with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
    than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
    complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code,
    to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.

    c) Accompany the executable with the information you received
    as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
    only if you received the executable with such an offer, in accord
    with Subsection 6b above.)

    d) If distribution is made by offering access to copy from a
    designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place.

  7. You may also copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with
  the Library.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.
  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License.

  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
  under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long
  as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
  and all its terms and conditions.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from
  the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with and/or modify
  the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
  impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
  compliance by third parties to this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
  not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
  this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a result
  you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library
  by all those who receive copies directly from you, then you cannot
  distribute the Library at all.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
  the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
  License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
  excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
  in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
  incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
  License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies a version number of this
  License which applies to it and "any later version", you have
  the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation. If the Library does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
  Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
  author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
  the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
  we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
  by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
  software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
  OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
  YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
  THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
  most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
  should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
  the full notice is found.

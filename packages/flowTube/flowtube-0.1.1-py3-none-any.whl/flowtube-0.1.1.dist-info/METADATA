# flowTube Package

A Python package for transport and diffusion calculations in cylindrical flow reactors, specifically designed for coated wall reactor (CWR) analysis with plans to support aerosol flow reactors in future versions.

## Features
Flow Calculations: Flow rates, velocities, residence times, and Reynolds numbers
Transport Properties: Dynamic viscosity and density
Diffusion Analysis: Binary diffusion coefficients, PÃ©clet numbers, and mixing parameters
Uptake Modeling: Diffusion correction factors and uptake coefficient calculations
Support for Inserts: Handles cylindrical coated inserts within flow tubes

## Scientific Applications
This package is designed for atmospheric chemistry and aerosol research, particularly for:
Heterogeneous reaction kinetics studies
Uptake coefficient measurements
Flow reactor design and optimization
Transport phenomena analysis in laminar flow systems

## Installation

```bash
pip install flowTube

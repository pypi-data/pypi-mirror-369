[motion-correction]
strategy = "Fourier"     # Strategy to use for motion correction.
                         # Valid values: Fourier, Plane, Markov
displacement = [50, 50]  # Maximum expected pixel displacement for motion correction.
                         # This should be provided in the form [x, y].

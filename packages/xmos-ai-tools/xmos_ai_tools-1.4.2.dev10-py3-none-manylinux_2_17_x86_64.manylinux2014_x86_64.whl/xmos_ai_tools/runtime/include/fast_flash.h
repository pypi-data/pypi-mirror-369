/** Fast flash library.
 * Before calling any of the functions in here, lib_quad_flash must be initialised as normal by using

 * After that, a call to fast_flash_init shall be made.
 * After that, a sequence of calls to fast_flash_read can be made.
 *
 * The data partition must start with the following 32 bytes: **NOTE: REMOVE THE +4 in fast_flash_init**
 *
 *   0xff, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x0f, 0x0f, 0x0f, 0x0f, 0x0f,

 *   0x31, 0xf7, 0xce, 0x08, 0x31, 0xf7, 0xce, 0x08,
 *   0x9c, 0x63, 0x9c, 0x63, 0x9c, 0x63, 0x9c, 0x63
 * 
 * This pattern is designed to create maximum difficulties electrically and is used
 * to calibrate the electrical settings. Note that this pattern must be nibble reversed
 * before being written to flash; just like all other data.
 * The rest of the data partition can be used as normal

    "# Memorizz: AI Agents with Comprehensive Memory Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memorizz** is an advanced memory management framework for AI agents that implements a sophisticated, cognitively-inspired memory architecture modeled after human memory systems. This system transcends traditional stateless interactions by providing persistent, structured memory capabilities that enable agents to learn, remember, and adapt across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the foundation of every MemAgent is a **Memory Provider** - the persistent storage and retrieval infrastructure built on MongoDB Atlas with vector search capabilities. This core component ensures agents maintain coherent identity, preserve interaction history, and accumulate knowledge over time through semantic embedding-based retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The cognitively-inspired memory architecture of Memorizz includes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† **Long-Term Memory Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Memory**: Factual and conceptual knowledge storage with vector-based semantic search and namespace organization\n",
    "2. **Procedural Memory**: Behavioral patterns, executable skills, and complex processes including:\n",
    "   - **Persona System**: Consistent agent personalities and behavioral characteristics\n",
    "   - **Toolbox**: Dynamically discoverable Python functions with LLM integration\n",
    "   - **Workflow Memory**: Multi-step process orchestration and execution tracking\n",
    "3. **Episodic Memory**: Experiential knowledge including conversational history and event summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö° **Short-Term Memory Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Working Memory**: Active context management and workspace for current interactions\n",

    "\n",
    "ü§ù **Multi-Agent Coordination**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Shared Memory**: Blackboard architecture enabling communication and coordination between multiple specialized agents in hierarchical workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**The memory-centric design philosophy of Memorizz enables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Learning**: Agents accumulate knowledge and experience across sessions through embedded semantic memory\n",
    "2. **Contextual Intelligence**: Sophisticated retrieval of relevant past interactions and knowledge to inform current responses\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Capability Discovery**: Semantic tool discovery allowing agents to identify and leverage appropriate functions\n",
    "4. **Process Continuity**: Workflow memory preserves multi-step task progress and learns from execution patterns\n",
    "5. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated task delegation and collaborative problem-solving through shared memory systems\n",
    "6. **Adaptive Personalities**: Persona-driven behavioral consistency with specialized role-based expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ **Application Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorizz provides flexible memory type allocation through application modes that activate specific memory combinations:\n",

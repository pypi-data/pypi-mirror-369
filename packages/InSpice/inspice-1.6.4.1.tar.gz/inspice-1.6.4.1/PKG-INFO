# InSpice

This repository has been forked from it's original repository PySpice.

## About

InSpice is a Python interface to the Ngspice and Xyce circuit simulators. It provides a Python API to describe electronic circuits and to run analog simulations.

## Installation

You can install InSpice from PyPI:

```bash
pip install inspice
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Innovoltive/InSpice.git
cd InSpice
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.12
- Ngspice (as shared library)
- matplotlib (for plotting)
- numpy (for numerical computation)

## Usage

See the `examples` directory for various examples of using InSpice.

Basic example:

```python
import InSpice
from InSpice.Unit import *

circuit = InSpice.Circuit('Simple RC Circuit')
circuit.R('1', 'input', 'output', 1@kΩ)
circuit.C('1', 'output', circuit.gnd, 1@µF)
```

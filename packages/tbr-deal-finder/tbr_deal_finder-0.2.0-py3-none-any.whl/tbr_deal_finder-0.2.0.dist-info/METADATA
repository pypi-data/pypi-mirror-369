Here are the steps to get your export.

### StoryGraph

* Click on your profile icon in the top right corner
* Select "Manage Account"
* Scroll down to "Manage Your Data"
* Click the button "Export StoryGraph Library"
* You will be navigated to https://app.thestorygraph.com/user-export
* Click "Generate export"
* Wait a few minutes and refresh the page
* A new item will appear that says "Your export from ... - Download" will appear
* Click "Download"

### Goodreads
* Open https://www.goodreads.com/review/import in the browser of your choice

### Custom csv
If you've got your own CSV you're using to track your TBRs all you need are the following columns for it to be in a valid format
* `Title`
* `Authors`
* `Read Status`* (See below)
 
Optionally, you can add the `Read Status` column. Set `to-read` for all books you want to be tracked.
If you don't add this column the deal finder will run on ALL books in the CSV.

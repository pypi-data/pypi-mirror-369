## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- ![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)
- Git (if cloning from source)

### **Installation**

You can install OpenCopilot using pip:

```bash
pip install pikoai
```

Alternatively, to install from source:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Piko-AI/OpenCopilot.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd OpenCopilot
    ```
3.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    or if you have multiple Python versions:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    -   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run OpenCopilot from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python Src/cli.py
```
or
```bash
python3 Src/cli.py
```

This will start OpenCopilot in conversational mode. You can also use it for one-shot tasks.

---

## ‚ö° One-Shot Task Execution

Execute tasks directly without entering the conversational mode:

```bash
python Src/cli.py --task "Your task description here"
```

You can also set the maximum number of iterations for a task:

```bash
python Src/cli.py --task "Your task description here" --max-iter 5
```

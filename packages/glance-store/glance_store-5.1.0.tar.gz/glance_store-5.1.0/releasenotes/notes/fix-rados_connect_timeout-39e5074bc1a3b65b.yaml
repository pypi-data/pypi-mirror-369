    RBD driver: the ``rados_connect_timeout`` config option has been
    un-deprecated and its behavior has been improved.  A value of ``0``
    is now respected as disabling timeout in requests, while a value less
    than zero indicates that glance_store will not set a timeout but
    instead will use whatever timeouts are set in the Ceph configuration
    file.

upgrade:
  - |
    RBD driver: the default value of the ``rados_connect_timeout`` option
    has been changed from 0 to -1, so that the RBD driver will by default
    use the timeout values defined in ``ceph.conf``. Be aware that
    setting this option to 0 disables timeouts (that is, the RBD driver
    will make requests with a timeout of zero, and all requests wait forever),
    thereby overriding any timeouts that are set in the Ceph configuration
    file.

    For the Cinder store, if using an internal user to store images,
    it is now possible to have the internal user and the internal project
    in Keystone domains other than the ``Default`` one.
    Two new config options ``cinder_store_user_domain_name`` and
    ``cinder_store_project_domain_name`` are added
    (both default to ``Default``) and now are possible to use in the
    configuration of the Cinder store.

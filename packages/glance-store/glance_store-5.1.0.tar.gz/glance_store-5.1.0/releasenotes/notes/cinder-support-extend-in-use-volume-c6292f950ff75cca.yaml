    Added support for extending in-use volumes in cinder store.
    A new boolean config option ``cinder_do_extend_attached`` is
    added which allows operators to enable/disable extending
    in-use volume support when creating an image.
    By default, ``cinder_do_extend_attached`` will be ``False``
    i.e. old flow of detaching, extending and attaching will be
    used.

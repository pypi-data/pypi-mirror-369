deprecations:
  - |
    The 'rados_connect_timeout' config option for the RBD store has been
    deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has been silently ignored
    for multiple releases. Users willing to set a timeout for the connection to
    the cluster can use Ceph's 'client_mount_timeout' option.

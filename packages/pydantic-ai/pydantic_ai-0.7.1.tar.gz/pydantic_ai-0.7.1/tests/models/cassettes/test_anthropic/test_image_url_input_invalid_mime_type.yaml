      - text: This is a Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), a large and powerful owl species native to the Americas. The
          owl is shown sitting on a branch surrounded by yellow-green foliage, with its distinctive mottled gray-brown feathers
          and prominent ear tufts (often called "horns"). It has striking yellow eyes that are looking directly at the camera,
          giving it an intense and alert appearance. Great Horned Owls are known for their excellent camouflage, powerful
          talons, and nocturnal hunting habits. They are widespread across North and South America and are one of the most
          common and adaptable owl species.

# Lace - AI Training Transparency Protocol

**Prevent copyright lawsuits by proving what you DIDN'T train on.**

Lace provides cryptographic proof of AI training provenance through loss trajectory monitoring. When model outputs resemble copyrighted content, you can prove definitively whether that content was in your training data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
pip install lace-client
```

```python
import lace

# Before training: Create attestation of your dataset
attestation_id = lace.attest("./training_data")

# During training: One-line integration (zero overhead)
lace.monitor()  # Automatically hooks into PyTorch/TensorFlow

# After training: Verify training relationship
result = lace.verify(attestation_id)
print(f"Correlation: {result['correlation']['score']:.3f}")
print(f"Legal verdict: {result['correlation']['verdict']}")
```

## üîë Get Your API Key

All processing happens in our secure cloud infrastructure for IP protection.

**Get your free API key:** [https://withlace.ai/request-demo](https://withlace.ai/request-demo)

```bash
export LACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## üí° How It Works

1. **Attestation**: Before training, Lace creates a cryptographic fingerprint of your dataset
2. **Monitoring**: During training, Lace captures loss trajectories with zero overhead
3. **Correlation**: After training, Lace proves the training relationship through loss curve analysis
4. **Legal Evidence**: Get legally-sufficient evidence for copyright defense

## üìä Integration Examples

### HuggingFace Transformers

```python
from transformers import Trainer
import lace

# Create attestation
attestation_id = lace.attest("./data")

# Train with monitoring
trainer = Trainer(model, args, dataset)
monitor = lace.monitor(attestation_id)
trainer.train()

# Get correlation
result = monitor.finalize()
```

### PyTorch

```python
import torch
import lace

# Start monitoring
lace.monitor()

# Your normal training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        loss = model(batch)
        loss.backward()  # Automatically captured!
        optimizer.step()
```

### TensorFlow/Keras

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import lace

# Start monitoring
lace.monitor()

# Your normal training
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)  # Automatically captured!
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal Protection

Lace combines multiple verification methods to provide legally defensible evidence:

- **Cryptographic proofs** that cannot be forged
- **Loss trajectory analysis** unique to your dataset
- **Behavioral verification** across multiple metrics
- **Bloom filter checks** with 99.99% accuracy

The probability of our verification being wrong is negligible - comparable to DNA evidence in court. When accused of training on copyrighted content, you have definitive proof of what was and wasn't in your dataset.

## üè¢ Enterprise Features

Look for areas that could potentially contain resources or useful items.\n   - **Action:** \n      - Try moving closer to trees or grass to collect wood or mining stones.\n      - Investigate adjacent structures (trees) to find supplies.\n\n**Optimizing Action:**\n   - If successful, gather as much wood/pickaxes/gems as possible.\n\nIf all else fails, perhaps we'll get more specific details from the game itself or the creator regarding how the game maps look. Without additional info on how the environment will look next, these steps remain best guesses based solely on the information available."

# EMDB Python Client

A Python client for accessing and interacting with the [Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/).  
This package provides an easy-to-use interface to query EMDB entries, access metadata, and download associated files.

## 🚀 Features
- Retrieve EMDB entries by ID
- Query metadata such as resolution, sample description, and related PDBs
- Download associated files (maps, images, metadata)
- Utility models for plotting and file handling
- Access to validation analysis and annotation data

## 📚 Documentation
Full API documentation is available at:

## 🔧 Installation
You can install the EMDB client via pip:

```bash
pip install emdb
```

## ✨ Quick Start
```python
from emdb.client import EMDB
from emdb.exceptions import EMDBNotFoundError

client = EMDB()

try:
    # Retrieve an entry by ID
    entry = client.get_entry("EMD-8117")
    print(entry.resolution)
    
    # Access cross-reference annotations
    annotations = entry.get_annotations()
    for annotation in annotations:
        print(annotation)
    
    # Access validation data and plot FSC
    validation = entry.get_validation()
    validation.plots.fsc.plot()
    
    # Download all files
    entry.download_all_files(output_dir="/tmp/emd1234/")
    
    # Perform a query to return EMDB entries
    results = client.search("HIV")
    for entry in results:
        print(entry.id, entry.method, entry.resolution)
    
    # Perform a query to return a DataFrame
    table = client.csv_search("HIV")
    print(table)
except EMDBNotFoundError:
    print("Entry not found.")
```

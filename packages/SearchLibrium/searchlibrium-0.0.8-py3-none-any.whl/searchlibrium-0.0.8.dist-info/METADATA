# SearchLibrium
## Econometric Models driven by Search and built on SearchLogit and MetaCountRegresssor

This repository contains the SearchLibrium package, which is a Python library designed for econometric models driven by search. It builds upon the foundations of SearchLogit and MetaCountRegressor, providing a robust framework for estimating data count models.

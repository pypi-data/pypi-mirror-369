# ðŸŽ¬ ffmPEG-this

> Your Video editor within CLI ðŸš€

A powerful and user-friendly batch script for converting, manipulating, and inspecting media files using the power of FFmpeg. This script provides a simple command-line menu to perform common audio and video tasks without needing to memorize complex FFmpeg commands.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Inspect Media Properties**: View detailed information about video and audio streams, including codecs, resolution, frame rate, bitrates, and more.
- **Convert & Transcode**: Convert videos and audio to a wide range of popular formats (MP4, MKV, WebM, MP3, FLAC, WAV, GIF) with simple quality presets.
- **Join Videos (Concatenate)**: Combine two or more videos into a single file. The tool automatically handles differences in resolution and audio sample rates for a seamless join.
- **Trim (Cut) Videos**: Easily cut a video to a specific start and end time without re-encoding for fast, lossless clips.
- **Visually Crop Videos**: An interactive tool that shows you a frame of the video, allowing you to click and drag to select the exact area you want to crop.
- **Extract Audio**: Rip the audio track from any video file into MP3, FLAC, or WAV.
- **Remove Audio**: Create a silent version of your video by stripping out all audio streams.
- **Batch Conversion**: Convert all media files in the current directory to a specified format in one go.

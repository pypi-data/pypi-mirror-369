- **Batch Conversion**: Convert all media files in the current directory to a specified format in one go.


## 🚀 Usage
### Prerequisite: Install FFmpeg

> `peg_this` uses a library called `ffmpeg-python` which acts as a controller for the main FFmpeg program. It does not include FFmpeg itself. Therefore, you must have FFmpeg installed on your system and available in your terminal's PATH.

For **macOS** users, the easiest way to install it is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

For **Windows** users, you can use a package manager like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install ffmpeg

# Using Scoop
scoop install ffmpeg
```

For other systems, please see the official download page: **[ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)**

There are ***three*** ways to use `peg_this`:

### 1. Pip Install (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started. This will install the tool and all its dependencies, including `ffmpeg`.

```bash
pip install peg_this
```

Once installed, you can run the tool from your terminal:

```bash
peg_this
```

### 2. Download from Release

If you don't want to install the package, you can download a pre-built executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/hariharen9/ffmpeg-this/releases/latest) page.

1.  Download the executable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2.  Place the downloaded file in a directory with your media files.
3.  Run the executable directly from your terminal or command prompt.

### 3. Run from Source

If you want to run the script directly from the source code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hariharen9/ffmpeg-this.git
    cd ffmpeg-this
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python src/peg_this/peg_this.py
    ```

# `gdm_robotics`: The Google DeepMind Robotics interfaces

This package describes a set of interfaces for Python reinforcement learning
(RL) environments. It consists of the following core components:

*   `gdm_robotics.interfaces.Environment`: An abstract base class for RL environments.
*   `gdm_robotics.interfaces.Policy`: An abstract base class for Agent policies.
*   `gdm_robotics.interfaces.EpisodicLogger`: An abstract base class for loggers for Agent/Environment interaction.
*   `gdm_robotics.runtime.RunLoop`: A concrete RunLoop class to run a policy against an environment and logging their interaction.

## Adapters

Common RL environment libraries such as `dm_env.Environment` and `gymnasium.Env`
can be exposed as `gdm_robotics.interfaces.Environment`s by using the provided
environment wrappers in the `adapter` sub-package, e.g. to wrap a
`dm_env.Environment` object:

```py
from gdm_robotics.adapters import dm_env_to_gdmr_env_wrapper

original_env: dm_env.Environment = ...
env = dm_env_to_gdmr_env_wrapper.DmEnvToGdmrEnvWrapper(original_env)
```

## Installation

`gdm_robotics` can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install gdm_robotics
```

Overview
--------
QFit is your go-to Python application for extracting parameters of superconducting circuits from measured spectroscopy data. Following the four-step workflow, you can get your circuit parameters in no time:

1. **Calibration**: QFit helps to establish the mapping from voltage (your experimental tunable input) to circuit parameters (your simulation ingredients). 

2. **Point Extraction**: With just a click, you can locate the resonance peak in the spectroscopy data with computer-assistance. The extracted data can be simply grouped as a transition and labeled. QFit even provides filters and coloring options for enhancing data visualization.

3. **Interactive Pre-fit**: See your numerical model result and the data on the same plot for intuitive comparison. Adjust the numerical simulator with simple sliders to improve your fit.

4. **Automated Fitting**: With one click, let the numerical optimizers do the work. You can easily configure your fitting: adjust which paramters are fixed or free, set their range, and more.

QFit supports a wide variety of circuit quantum electrodynamic systems, thanks to the powerful Python library `scqubits` as its backend simulator. Once you've extracted your parameters, you can pass them directly to scQubits for any further numerical simulations you need to do. 

Join us in refining QFit during its beta phase! Your insights and reports are invaluable in making QFit a robust tool for this community. Dive in and explore what QFit can do for you, and let us know your experience!

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to install `QFit`:

1. (Optional but highly Recommended) Create a virtual environment with python (version >= 3.10). If you are using conda, run on terminal
```
    conda create -n <env name> python=3.10
    conda activate <env name>
```
2. Then, install `QFit` by
```
    conda install conda-forge::qfit
```
Once done, the application can be launched in a jupyter notebook session via
```
    from qfit import Fit
    Fit(<HilbertSpace>)
```
where `<HilbertSpace>` is a `scqubits.HilbertSpace` object, the circuit model you want to fit against. 

> [!NOTE]
> While you can install QFit with `pip install qfit`, this application is unstable on machines with Apple silicons. This is due to compatibility issues with pip-installed `scipy`. As a workaround, you can run `conda install scipy` afterward, though using conda for the full installation is preferred.

Usage
-----
Please check out the notebook [QFit_Quick_Start.ipynb](./example_notebooks/QFit_Quick_Start.ipynb) for a quick tutorial, and [QFit_Advanced_Tips.ipynb](./example_notebooks/QFit_Advanced_Tips.ipynb) for further information.

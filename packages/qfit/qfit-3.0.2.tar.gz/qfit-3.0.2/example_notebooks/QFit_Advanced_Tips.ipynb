    "You may wish to fit parameters with mutiple two-tone spectroscopy data, for example in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- You performed a coarse scan over a wide range of DC voltage, and performed a more refined scan near the sweet spot of the qubit to resolve the qubit frequency.\n",
    "- Your device has multiple DC voltage sources to control magnetic flux and/or offset charge, and you need to determine the relation between input DC voltages and the tuning parameters, which has to be fully determined with multiple two-tone spectroscopies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Requirements for the data files\n",
    "`QFit` supports loading multiple spectroscopy data files and fit against all of them. There are a few requirements for the data files being loaded together:\n",
    "1. Each data file represent a single run two-tone spectroscopy experiment. It should  contains \n",
    "    - a few 2D spectroscopy arrays with the same shape (usually amplitude and phase) \n",
    "    - a few 1D arrays for axes coordinates. They should have the same length as the spectroscopy arrays' x or y dimension. When they are absent, especially when the data is just an image, `QFit` will generate the coordinate automatically.\n",
    "2. All the data files used within the fitting session should contain the same coordinates' names (i.e. \"voltage\" for the DC voltage source axes).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above two requirements, `QFit` accepts various input data formats including hdf5, matlab, and images. We hope to make `QFit` as easy to use as possible. Reach out to us if you want to use `QFit` with your own data format."

    "#### Calibration\n",
    "1. You can adjust your calibration (specifically the mapped values) in pre-fit (through sliders) and fit (through optimizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extraction \n",
    "1. **Choose your points wisely!** More points with distinctive x-value being selected = longer calculation time. You may want to select representative points for fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For transitions, selecting bare or dressed labels means that you mark your initial and final states using bare indices (states are labelled by excitations of individual subsystems) or dressed indices (states are regarded as eigenstates of the entire system and labelled as 0, 1, 2, 3,... in ascending order of energy). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you do not know what label should be given to a group of points, you may choose the \"Unknown\" label, and come back to label it later once you have a better idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transitions may not necessarily start from the ground states; sometimes a higher-lying states are populated so the transitions from this high-lying state is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-fit\n",
    "1. If your circuit system is computationally demanding (e.g. many-node circuits or a system of many coupled qubits), you may try following strategies:\n",
    "    - Use smaller `truncated_dim` for each subsystem within the Hilbert space, and/or reduce number of basis states (cutoffs) of each circuit; this may have a tradeoff on accuracy, though.\n",
    "    - Reduce `POINTS ADDED` in the spectrum settings. \n",
    "    - Select points in a way that distinctive x-value is less. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. After calibration, you may go ahead to pre-fit and adjust sliders to compute transitions and compare against two-tone spectroscopies directly, then extract and label peaks in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous\n",
    "1. After importing experimental data, you can always switch between different panels to perform fit.\n"

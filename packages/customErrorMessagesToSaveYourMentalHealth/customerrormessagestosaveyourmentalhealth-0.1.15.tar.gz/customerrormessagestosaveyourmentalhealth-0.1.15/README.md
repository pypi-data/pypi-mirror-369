1. Import
    ```python
    from customErrorMessagesToSaveYourMentalHealth import ErrorHandler
    import sys
    ```

* (Optional) Import your custom themes
    * Note: these must be as a dictionary structured like so:
        ```python
        my_custom_themes = {"happy": ["happy message 1", "happy message 2"],
                            "goofy": ["goofy message 1", "goofy message 2", "goofy message 3"]}
        ```
    * To import:
        ```python
        from my_file_containing_my_themes import my_custom_themes
        ```

2. Basic structure
    ```python
    sys.excepthook = error_handler(exc_type,
                  exc_value,
                  exc_traceback,
                  message="üçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜ ur mom is so beautiful", 
                  theme_name=None,
                  custom_themes=None,
                  theme_mode="default",
                  want_original=False):
    ```

    When calling it, you need lambda though!!!! Because sys.excepthook only expects those three specific parameters.
    ```python
    sys.excepthook = lambda exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb: error_handler(
    exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb, theme_name="brainrot"
)
    ```
    This will select random themes from only your custom themes.

Parameters: \
`message` - The message you want to write out if you don't want to pick a themed message \
`theme_name` - The name of the theme e.g. `"romance"` (Only a few are supported right now because I have a life outside of this stupid crap) \
`custom_themes` - set this equal to your custom themes if you got any
`theme_mode` - `"default"`, `"custom"`, or `"both"` \
`want_original` - if you want the original error (it'll give you `__excepthook__`)

If you are illiterate and don't put things in correctly the code will be mean to you and then default to the default themes. 

**Current themes supported**
* `"romance"` (3)
* `"sad"` (3)
* `"danger"` (3) (created by chatgpt w/ minimal editing ngl)
* `"brainrot"` (3) \
There's also a special one called `"motivate me"`. If you keep this as your `theme_name` you will not make any errors, I promise.

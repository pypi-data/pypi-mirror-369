## ‚ú® Features

| Command          | What it does                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `b3th sync`      | **Stage ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push** in one shot. b3th asks an LLM for a succinct commit subject + body, then runs `git add --all`, `git commit`, and `git push -u origin &lt;branch&gt;`. |
| `b3th prcreate`  | Pushes the current branch (if needed), summarises commits + diff, and opens a GitHub pull-request, returning the PR URL.                                                        |
| `b3th prdraft`   | Opens a **draft** pull-request (marked ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù on GitHub) after generating the title/body with the LLM.                                                                         |
| `b3th stats`     | Shows commit count, unique files touched, and line additions/deletions for a given time-frame (e.g. `--last 7d`).                                                               |
| `b3th summarize` | Uses an LLM to produce a one-paragraph summary of the last _N_ commits (default 10).                                                                                            |
| `b3th resolve`   | Scans for Git **merge conflicts**, builds a per-file prompt, asks the LLM for a merged version, writes `<file>.resolved`; `--apply` overwrites originals with the suggestions.  |

_(The legacy `b3th commit` still works but prints a deprecation warning and delegates to **sync**.)_

Under the hood, b3th leverages **Groq‚Äôs Chat Completions API** for language generation and the **GitHub REST API** for PR creation.
It also **auto-loads environment variables** from a project `.env` **and** your **user-level `.env`** so credentials ‚Äújust work‚Äù.

## Quick Install

### 1 ¬∑ Prerequisites

- **Python ‚â• 3.9**
- **Git** in your `PATH`.
- **Poetry** (preferred) or plain `pip`. <sub>Install Poetry ‚Üí `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`</sub>

### 2 ¬∑ Install the package

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A ‚Äì From PyPI</strong> (when published)</summary>

```bash
pipx install b3th         # keeps deps isolated
# or
pip install --user b3th
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B ‚Äì From source</strong> (recommended for contributors)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bethvourc/b3th.git
cd b3th
poetry install
```

</details>

### 3 ¬∑ Set up your secrets

Put your credentials in **either** a project-level `.env` **or** your **user-level `.env`**:

```dotenv
# ~/.env  (user-level)  OR  <repo>/.env  (project-level)
GROQ_API_KEY="sk_live_xxx"        # https://console.groq.com/keys
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxx"            # PAT with repo scope ‚Üí https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Optional overrides
# GROQ_MODEL_ID="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
```

> **How env loading works**
>
> - b3th first reads your **current process environment** (already-exported vars).
> - Then it loads a **project `.env`** if present (repo root or parent directories).
> - Finally, it loads your **user-level `.env`** at `~/.env`.
> - Existing process env vars are **not overwritten** by `.env` values.
>
> **Security tip:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` and avoid committing secrets.

### 4 ¬∑ (Dev only) Install Git hooks

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install   # auto-format & lint on each commit
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
# One-shot stage ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push
poetry run b3th sync                   # interactive
poetry run b3th sync -y                # non-interactive

# Create a pull-request into 'main'
poetry run b3th prcreate               # interactive
poetry run b3th prcreate -b develop -y # specify base branch, skip confirm

# Create a draft pull-request to 'main'
poetry run b3th prdraft               # interactive confirm
poetry run b3th prdraft -b develop -y # specify base branch, skip confirm

# Git statistics (last 7 days)
poetry run b3th stats --last 7d

# Summarise last 15 commits
poetry run b3th summarize -n 15

# Generate conflict suggestions (writes *.resolved files)
poetry run b3th resolve

# Accept suggestions and overwrite originals
poetry run b3th resolve --apply
```

### Sync Demo

```text
$ b3th sync
Proposed commit message:
feat(utils): support .env loading

Load environment variables automatically from .env (project or user-level)
so users don't need to export them manually each session.

Proceed with commit & push? [y/N]: y
üöÄ Synced! Commit pushed to origin.
```

### Stats Demo

```bash
$ b3th stats --last 7d
Commits:    14
Files:      6
Additions:  +120
Deletions:  -34
```

### Summarize Demo

```bash
$ b3th summarize -n 10
Introduce a comprehensive stats command, improve README instructions,
and fix a minor UI colour bug‚Äîenhancing insight, onboarding, and UX.
```

### Resolve Demo

```bash
# Create .resolved files next to conflicted originals
$ b3th resolve
üîç Detecting conflicts & asking the LLM‚Ä¶
üí° Generated 2 *.resolved file(s).
Inspect the *.resolved files. Run again with --apply to accept.

# Overwrite originals with merged suggestions
$ b3th resolve --apply
‚úÖ Originals overwritten with LLM suggestions.
```

### Conflict-Resolver Workflow

1. **Run** `b3th resolve` to generate `<file>.resolved` for each conflicted file.
2. **Review** the proposed merges; tweak if needed.
3. **Apply** with `b3th resolve --apply` to overwrite originals and remove the `.resolved` files.
4. **Commit** your merged changes.

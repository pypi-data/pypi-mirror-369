Handling of OWL restriction for domain and range (#1266)

# Description

Often a property is not only defined for a single concept, but re-used
for multiple concepts. In case of ontological modeling this is achieved
by applying owl restrictions on rdfs:domain and rdfs:range when defining
an owl property. Now we are able to parse these restrictions, which
leads to step closer to lossless importing of ontologies into neat
expression of data model.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Added

- Parsing of OWL restrictions for domain and range when those as
expressed as blank nodes (i.e. using owl:unionOf , owl:intersectionOf)

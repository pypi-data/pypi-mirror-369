Adding write endpoints for neat.data_model (#1262)

# Description

This PR adds (copy) endpoint for writing data model from NeatSession to
targeted format (ontology, shacl) or CDF.

Risk reviewing: This PR does not bring any new functionalities. Methods
already exist but are accessible via functional approach in interaction
with NeatSession. They are copied to be "object oriented" accessible.
There are already existing tests, so no tests are added.

This is stacked PR on top of #1261 

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Added

- Data model write endpoints accessible via `neat.data_model.write[yaml,
ontology, shacl, cdf, excel]`

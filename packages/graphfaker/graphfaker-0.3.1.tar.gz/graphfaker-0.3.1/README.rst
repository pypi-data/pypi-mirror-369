graphfaker
==========

graphfaker is a python library for generating and loading synthetic and real-world datasets tailored for graph-based applications. It supports `faker` as social graph, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, and real airline flight networks. Use it for data science, research, teaching, rapid prototyping, and more!

Problem Statement
-----------------

Graph data is essential for solving complex problems in various fields, including social network analysis, transportation modeling, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, many professionals, researchers, and students face a common challenge: a lack of easily accessible, realistic graph datasets for testing, learning, and benchmarking. Real-world graph data is often restricted due to privacy concerns, complexity, or large size, making experimentation difficult.

Solution: graphfaker
--------------------

GraphFaker is an open-source Python library designed to generate, load, and export synthetic graph datasets in a user-friendly and configurable way. It enables users to generate graphs tailored to their specific needs, allowing for better experimentation and learning without needing to think about where the data is coming from or how to fetch the data.

Features
========

- **Multiple Graph Sources:**
  - ``faker``: Synthetic “social-knowledge” graphs powered by Faker (people, places, organizations, events, products with rich attributes and relationships)
  - ``osm``: Real-world street networks directly from OpenStreetMap (by place name, address, or bounding box)
  - ``flights``: Flight/airline networks from Bureau of Transportation Statistics (airlines ↔ airports ↔ flight legs, complete with cancellation and delay flags)

- **Unstructured Data Source:**
  - ``WikiFetcher``: Raw Wikipedia page data (title, summary, content, sections, links, references) ready for custom graph or entity recognition

- **Easy CLI & Python Library**


*Vision:: To remove friction around data acquisition, letting you focus on algorithms, teaching, or rapid prototyping.*

   * - Source
     - What It Gives You
   * - **Faker**
     - Synthetic social-knowledge graphs with configurable sizes, weighted and directional relationships.
   * - **OSM**
     - Real road or walking networks via OSMnx under the hood—fetch by place, address, or bounding box; simplify topology; project to UTM.
   * - **Flights**
     - Airline/airport graph from BTS on-time performance data: nodes for carriers, airports, flights; edges for OPERATED_BY, DEPARTS_FROM, ARRIVES_AT; batch or date-range support; subgraph sampling.
   * - **Wikipedia**
     - Raw page dumps (title, summary, content, sections, links, references) as JSON.

.. note::

   This is still a work in progress (WIP). Includes logging and debugging print statements. Our goal for releasing early is to get feedback and reiterate.

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell

   uv pip install graphfaker

For development:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/graphgeeks-lab/graphfaker.git
   cd graphfaker
   uv pip install -e .

Quick Start
-----------

Python Library Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from graphfaker import GraphFaker

   gf = GraphFaker()
   # Synthetic social/knowledge graph
   g1 = gf.generate_graph(source="faker", total_nodes=200, total_edges=800)
   # OSM road network
   g2 = gf.generate_graph(source="osm", place="Chinatown, San Francisco, California", network_type="drive")
   # Flight network
   g3 = gf.generate_graph(source="flights", year=2024, month=1)

      # Fetch Wikipedia page data
   from graphfaker import WikiFetcher
   page = WikiFetcher.fetch_page("Graph theory")
   print(page['summary'])
   print(page['content'])
   WikiFetcher.export_page_json(page, "graph_theory.json")

Advanced: Date Range for Flights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note this isn't recommended and it's still being tested. We are working on ways to make this faster.

.. code-block:: python

   g = gf.generate_graph(source="flights", country="United States", date_range=("2024-01-01", "2024-01-15"))

CLI Usage (WIP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show help:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m graphfaker.cli --help

Generate a Synthetic Social Graph:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
       --source faker \
       --total-nodes 100 \
       --total-edges 500

Generate a Real-World Road Network (OSM):

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
       --source osm \
       --place "Berlin, Germany" \
       --network-type drive \
       --export berlin.graphml

Generate a Flight Network (Airlines/Airports/Flights):

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
       --source flights \
       --country "United States" \
       --year 2024 \
       --month 1

You can also use `--date-range` for custom time spans (e.g., `--date-range "2024-01-01,2024-01-15"`).

Future Plans: Graph Export Formats
----------------------------------

- **GraphML**: General graph analysis/visualization (`--export graph.graphml`)
- **JSON/JSON-LD**: Knowledge graphs/web apps (`--export data.json`)
- **CSV**: Tabular analysis/database imports (`--export edges.csv`)
- **RDF**: Semantic web/linked data (`--export graph.ttl`)

Future Plans: Integration with Graph Tools
------------------------------------------

GraphFaker generates NetworkX graph objects that can be easily integrated with:

- **Graph databases**: Neo4j, Kuzu, TigerGraph
- **Analysis tools**: NetworkX, SNAP, graph-tool
- **ML frameworks**: PyTorch Geometric, DGL, TensorFlow GNN
- **Visualization**: G.V, Gephi, Cytoscape, D3.js


What's on the Horizon?
----------------------

- Handling large graph -> millions of nodes
- Using NLP/LLM to fetch graph data -> "Fetch flight data for Jan 2024"
- Connects to any graph database/engine of choice -> "Establish connections to graph database/engine of choice"

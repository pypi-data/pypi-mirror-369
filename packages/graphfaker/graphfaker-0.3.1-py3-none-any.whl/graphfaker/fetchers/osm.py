        OSMGraphFetcher: Fetch and preprocess street networks from OpenStreetMap via OSMnx.

            ) -> nx.MultiDiGraph
                Fetch a street network and project it to UTM for accurate spatial analysis.

        Parameters:
            place (str, optional): A geographic name (e.g., "London, UK") to geocode and fetch.
            address (str, optional): A specific address or point-of-interest to geocode and fetch around.
            bbox (tuple, optional): A bounding box as (north, south, east, west) coordinates.
            network_type (str): OSMnx network type: "drive", "walk", "bike", or "all".
            simplify (bool): If True, simplify the graph topology (merge intersections).
            retain_all (bool): If True, keep all connected components; else largest only.
            dist (float): Search radius in meters when fetching by address.

        Returns:
            nx.MultiDiGraph: Projected street network graph (UTM coordinates).

        Raises:
            ValueError: If none of place, address, or bbox is provided.
            ImportError: If OSMnx is not installed.

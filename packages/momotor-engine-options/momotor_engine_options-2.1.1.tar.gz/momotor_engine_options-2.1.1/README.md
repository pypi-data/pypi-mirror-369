This package is a part of [Momotor](https://momotor.org/), a tool for automated processing of digital content. 

Momotor accepts digital content as a product bundle and generates a result bundle from this product under 
control of a recipe bundle. 

Momotor is like a continuous integration system, but broader in scope. The 
type of content that Momotor can process is not restricted; each recipe may impose its own constraints. 
One application of Momotor in an educational setting is the automatic generation of feedback on work submitted 
for programming assignments.

The `momotor-engine-options` package provides methods to process options in Momotor recipe and configuration
bundles. It also includes the handlers for options in the "scheduler" and "tools" domains.

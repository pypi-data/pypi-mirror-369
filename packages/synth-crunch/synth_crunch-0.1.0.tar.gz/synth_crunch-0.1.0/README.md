# Your first model

You may use the following code as a baseline submission, which has been adapted from the [official Synth Subnet example](https://github.com/mode-network/synth-subnet/blob/f66ea914bd62cd4c173da98ba1061a287242dbba/synth/miner/simulations.py#L10).

# Test it locally

Your miner can test on either historical or live data.

We recommend using historical data for quick iterations because you can be scored immediately. 

When you are ready to use the brand new data, use the live data. However, you will have to wait before you can be scored.

Once you have generated your simulations, they are validated to ensure that you are ready for the network.

## Running using historical data

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Import the function
from synth_crunch import test_historical

# Run the tester
result = test_historical(
    # You must instantiate your miner.
    MyMiner(),

    # Specify which asset you want to run with: "BTC," "ETH," "XAU," or "SOL".
    "BTC",

    # Customize the start date (default to 1st of February 2024 at 02:00 PM).
    start=datetime(2024, 2, 1, 14),

    # Customize the time increment between two predictions (default to 5min).
    time_increment=300,

    # Customize the duration of a simulation; it must be a divisor of the time increment (default to 24h).
    time_length=86400,

    # Customize the number of simulations to run (default to 300).
    num_simulations=300,
)
```

> [!TIP]
> Using the same `start` and `time_increment` parameters will make subsequent execution faster because the prices will be cached in memory.

## Running using live data

```python
# Import the function
from synth_crunch import test_live

# Run the tester
result = test_live(
    # You must instantiate your miner.
    MyMiner(),

    # Specify which asset you want to run with: "BTC," "ETH," "XAU," or "SOL".
    "BTC",

    # Customize the time increment between two predictions (default to 1min).
    time_increment=60,

    # Customize the duration of a simulation; it must be a divisor of the time increment (default to 5min).
    time_length=300,

    # Customize the number of simulations to run (default to 100).
    num_simulations=100,
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The longer your `time_length` is, the longer you will have to wait to score your simulations.

## Visualize the simulations

It's easy to plot your simulations in one line.

```python
# Import the function
from synth_crunch import visualize_simulations

visualize_simulations(
    result,

    # Customize the figure size (default to (10, 6)).
    figsize=(10, 6),
)
```

The code will produce the following:

![visualization](./assets/visualization.png)

## Score the simulations

Your simulations will be scored using [Synth Subnet's scoring function](https://github.com/mode-network/synth-subnet/blob/d076dc3bcdf93256a278dfec1cbe72b0c47612f6/synth/validator/crps_calculation.py#L5).

If you run a test using live data, you will have to wait for the targets to resolve before you can score them. The function will wait by default (`time.sleep(x)`) until the time comes. If you do not want to wait, an error will be raised instead.

```python
# Import the function
from synth_crunch import score_simulations

# Score your results
scored_result = score_simulations(
    result,

    # Use sleep to wait until the targets are resolved (default to True).
    wait_until_resolved=True,
)

print("My miner score is:", scored_result.score)
print()

print("More details:")
print(scored_result.score_summary)
```

> [!WARNING]
> This will not be your score on the leaderboard. When multiple miners are scored to generate a leaderboard, [the scores are first subtracted from the lowest miner's score. Then, the prompt score is used to compute the rewards.](https://github.com/mode-network/synth-subnet/blob/d076dc3bcdf93256a278dfec1cbe72b0c47612f6/synth/validator/reward.py#L180)

# Accessing more data (for training only)

For this competition, you may use any data you wish for your training.

The library exposes a mini Python client, which allows you to easily access asset prices.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Pyth data is only available for training. This is because no Internet connection is possible when running on the platform.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Import the function
from synth_crunch import pyth

prices = pyth.get_price_history(
    # Specify which asset you want to get data of: "BTC," "ETH," "XAU," or "SOL".
    asset="BTC",

    # Start time of the data
    from_=datetime(2024, 1, 1),

    # End time of the data
    to=datetime(2024, 1, 2),
)
```

The prices are represented using a `pandas.Series` of `float`, using `datetime` as index.

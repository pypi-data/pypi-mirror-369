pydantic-settings-manager
========================

A library for managing Pydantic settings objects.

This library provides a unified SettingsManager class that can handle both single
and multiple settings configurations:

- SettingsManager: Unified settings manager (recommended)
  - Single mode: SettingsManager(MySettings)
  - Multi mode: SettingsManager(MySettings, multi=True)

DEPRECATED CLASSES (will be removed in v2.0.0):
- BaseSettingsManager: Use SettingsManager instead
- SingleSettingsManager: Use SettingsManager instead
- MappedSettingsManager: Use SettingsManager(MySettings, multi=True) instead

Features:
- Loading settings from multiple sources
- Command line argument overrides
- Settings validation through Pydantic
- Thread-safe operations
- Type-safe configuration management

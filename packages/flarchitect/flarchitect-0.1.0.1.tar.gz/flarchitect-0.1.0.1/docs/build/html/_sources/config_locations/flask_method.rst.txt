Flask Method Config Globals
==============================

    Global < **Global Method** < Model < Model Method

:bdg-dark-line:`Global Method`

These values are defined in the `Flask`_ config, but are constrained to specific http methods.

-  They should always be uppercase
-  They should always start with ``API_{method}_``

Values defined here will apply globally per method unless a more specific value is defined, they overwrite the global
value if they are defined.

Will be overridden by value types;  :bdg-dark-line:`Global Method`, :bdg-dark-line:`Model`, :bdg-dark-line:`Model Method`.

Overrides :bdg-dark-line:`Global`


Example
--------------

.. code:: python

    class Config():

        API_POST_RATE_LIMIT = "1 per minute"
        API_GET_RATE_LIMIT = "2 per minute"
        API_PUT_RATE_LIMIT = "3 per minute"

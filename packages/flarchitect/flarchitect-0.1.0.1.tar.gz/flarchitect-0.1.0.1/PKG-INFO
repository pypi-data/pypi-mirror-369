flarchitect is a friendly Flask extension that turns your SQLAlchemy or Flask-SQLAlchemy models into a production-ready REST API with almost no boilerplate. It automatically builds CRUD endpoints, generates interactive Redoc documentation and keeps responses consistent so you can focus on your application logic.

## Why flarchitect?

If you're new here, welcome! flarchitect gets you from data models to a fully fledged REST API in minutes, letting you focus on the features that matter rather than plumbing.

## Features

- **Automatic CRUD endpoints** – expose SQLAlchemy models as RESTful resources with a simple `Meta` class.
- **Interactive documentation** – Redoc or Swagger UI generated at runtime and kept in sync with your models.
- **Built-in authentication** – JWT, basic and API key strategies ship with a ready‑made `/auth/login` endpoint, or plug in your own.
- **Extensibility hooks** – customise request and response flows.
- **Soft delete** – hide and restore records without permanently removing them.

### Optional extras

- **Rate limiting & structured responses** – configurable throttling and consistent response schema.
- **Field validation** – built-in validators for emails, URLs, IPs and more.
- **Nested writes** – send related objects in POST/PUT payloads when `API_ALLOW_NESTED_WRITES` is `True`.
- **CORS support** – enable cross-origin requests with `API_ENABLE_CORS`.

## Installation

flarchitect supports Python 3.10 and newer. Set up a virtual environment, install the package and verify the install:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flarchitect
python -c "import flarchitect; print(flarchitect.__version__)"
```

The final command prints the version number to confirm everything installed correctly.

## Quick Start

```python
from flask import Flask
from flarchitect import Architect
from models import Author, BaseModel  # your SQLAlchemy models

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["API_TITLE"] = "My API"
app.config["API_VERSION"] = "1.0"
app.config["API_BASE_MODEL"] = BaseModel
app.config["API_ALLOW_NESTED_WRITES"] = True

architect = Architect(app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

With the application running, try your new API in another terminal window:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/authors
```

## OpenAPI specification

An OpenAPI 3 schema is generated automatically and powers the Redoc UI. You
can switch to Swagger‑UI by setting ``API_DOCS_STYLE = 'swagger'`` in your Flask
config. Either way you can serve the raw specification to integrate with
tooling such as Postman:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flarchitect import Architect

app = Flask(__name__)
architect = Architect(app)  # OpenAPI served at /openapi.json
```

The specification endpoint can be customised with ``API_SPEC_ROUTE``. See the
[OpenAPI docs](docs/source/openapi.rst) for exporting or customising the
document.

Read about hiding and restoring records in the [soft delete section](docs/source/advanced_configuration.rst#soft-delete).

## Running Tests

To run the test suite locally:

```bash
pytest
```

## Roadmap

Check out the [project roadmap](docs/source/roadmap.rst) for upcoming features and enhancements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that linters and tests pass locally:

```bash
ruff --fix .
pytest
```

## Versioning & Releases

The package version is defined in `pyproject.toml` and exposed as `flarchitect.__version__`. A GitHub Actions workflow automatically publishes to PyPI when the version changes on `master`.

To publish a new release:

1. Update the `version` field in `pyproject.toml` (for example with `hatch version patch`).
2. Commit and push to `master`.

Ensure the repository has a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret with an API token from PyPI.

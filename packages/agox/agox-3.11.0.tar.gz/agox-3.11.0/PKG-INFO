# Atomistic Global Optimization X (AGOX)

![logo](docs/source/logos/logo-carbon.gif)


AGOX is a package for global optimization of atomic system using e.g. the energy 
calculated from density functional theory as the objective function. AGOX interfaces 
with the Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE) and as such supports any of 
calculators in ASE as objectives for optimization. 

AGOX is built to be flexible, consisting of modules that can be put together to 
create an optimization algorithm, from simple random searches to Bayesian searches 
guided by a surrogate model and many more.

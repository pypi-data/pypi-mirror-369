Release notes
=============

Version 4.1 (2025-08-14)
========================

Added "allow_overlaps" configuration parameter. This allows files
or groups of files with completely mixed up lines.

Version 4.0 (2025-08-04)
========================

This version does not have any new features or changes; there are only
build changes. We have moved from ``setup.py`` to ``pyproject.toml``
and we are furthermore using ``setuptools-scm``. We have stopped
supporting unsupported Python and Windows versions, and therefore
running ``loggertodb`` on Windows 7 is no longer an option. We have
added a GitHub action to automatically build a Windows executable
upon publishing a new release.

Version 3.1 (2024-07-29)
========================

New features:

- The "simple" format can now include flags.
- A ``max_records`` parameter, by default 10,000, has been added, to limit
  the size of uploaded time series.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed error when a line had insufficient items.
- Fixed error message where, in case of error, a random filename instead
  of the correct filename would be shown in multi-file format.

Minor improvements:

- A pandas FutureWarning has been removed.
- Added some more log messages at the "info" level.

Version 3.0 (2022-12-05)
========================

Briefly, this version is timezone-aware.

Enhydris 4.0 handles time zones better than 3.x, but it has some
breaking changes in the API, namely that when uploading data the time
zone must be specified. Accordingly, loggertodb 3.0 is compatible with
Enhydris 4.0 and incompatible with previous Enhydris versions.

In this loggertodb version, the ``timezone`` configuration parameter
must always be specified, and it is used to interpret all timestamps
(whereas in previous versions it was used only for DST changes).

Version 2.2 (2021-01-13)
========================

This makes loggertodb compatible with a new version of Enhydris that
no longer has a "raw" time series type, and instead has an "initial"
time series type. (This update has occurred in an internal unnumbered
Enhydris release that precedes the release of Enhydris 3).

Changes in 2.2 microversions
----------------------------

2.2.1 (2022-11-06)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Bug fix: If an error occurs during data uploading, the error is
  correctly shown and logged (and the traceback also logged in DEBUG
  level), whereas in 2.2.0 it crashed with an irrelevant message.

Version 2.1 (2020-11-17)
========================

The ``nullstr`` parameter has been renamed to ``null``, keeping
``nullstr`` as a deprecated synonym. If the value of ``null`` is a
number, it is interpreted as a number instead of as a string.

Version 2.0 (2020-10-14)
========================

``loggertodb`` version 2 is not compatible with Enhydris versions
earlier than 3.  Use ``loggertodb`` version 1 for Enhydris version 2.

Token authentication
--------------------

``loggertodb`` used to use a username and password to logon to Enhydris.
Now it uses a token instead. Accordingly, the ``username`` and
``password`` configuration file parameters have been abolished and
``auth_token`` has been introduced. See the :ref:`documentation on
authentication <authentication>` for more detailed instructions.

Time series groups
------------------

Enhydris 3 contains the notion of a time series groupâ€”a group of related
time series for the same variable, e.g. the initial, checked and
aggregated versions of a time series. Accordingly, ``loggertodb`` has
been changed so that the ``fields`` parameter and the wdat5-specific
meteorological parameters specify time series group ids rather than time
series ids.  ``loggertodb`` will always upload data in the "initial"
time series of the time series group; if such a time series does not
exist, it is automatically created.

How to upgrade from version 1
-----------------------------

If you have a ``loggertodb`` v1 configuration file, ``loggertodb`` v2 can
convert it. Enter this:

   :samp:`loggertodb --upgrade {loggertodb.conf}`

where :samp:`{loggertodb.conf}` is the configuration file you want to
upgrade.  ``loggertodb`` will make requests to Enhydris in order to
determine the ``auth_token`` from ``username`` and ``password``, and the
time series group ids from the time series ids.  The configuration file
will be upgraded accordingly. The original file will be backed up by
adding the ``.bak`` extension (e.g. ``loggertodb.conf.bak``). (If the
backup file already exists and is different from the original,
``loggertodb`` will terminate with an error.)

Changes in 2.0 microversions
----------------------------

2.0.1 (2020-10-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed inability of the 2.0.0 Windows executable to run on Windows 7.

2.0.2 (2020-10-23)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed malfunctioning Windows executable (it had been built with wrong
  dependencies).

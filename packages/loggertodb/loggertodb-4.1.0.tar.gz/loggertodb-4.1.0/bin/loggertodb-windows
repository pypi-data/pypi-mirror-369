"""Executable script for pyinstaller.

Normally we shouldn't need this script. "pip install loggertodb"
installs a "loggertodb" script which has been created because of
pyproject.toml's [project.scripts]. However, pyinstaller, which we use
to create a single-file loggertodb.exe on windows, does not support
"project.scripts", so we add this script which is more or less identical
to the one created by setuptools.

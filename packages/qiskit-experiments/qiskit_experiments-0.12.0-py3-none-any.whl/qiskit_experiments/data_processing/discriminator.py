    This class allows developers to implement their own discriminators or wrap discriminators
    from external libraries which therefore ensures that the discriminator fits in
    the data processing chain. This class defines an interface for discriminator objects.
    Subclasses must implement the following methods:

    - :meth:`predict`: called in the :class:`.Discriminator` data-action class to predict
      labels from the input level-one data.
    - :meth:`config`: produces the config file to serialize and deserialize the discriminator.
    - :meth:`is_trained`: indicates if the discriminator is trained, i.e., fit to training data.

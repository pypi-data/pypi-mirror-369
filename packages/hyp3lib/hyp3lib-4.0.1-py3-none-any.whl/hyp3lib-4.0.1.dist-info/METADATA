# HyP3-lib: A Common library for HyP3 plugins

> [!WARNING]
> HyP3-lib is currently undergoing a major redesign and many utilities that are no longer used by existing HyP3 plugins have been removed between version 2 and version 3. In addition, we plan to migrate some remaining functionality to other projects and to significantly refactor what remains. For this reason, **if you are using HyP3-lib we strongly recommend pinning to major versions at this time**.

## Purpose
The goal of this package is to provide ASF's various HyP3 plugins with a set of utilities they can use to perform common tasks. This could include tasks such as downloading Sentinel-1 orbit data, or verifying that NASA EarthData credentials are available.

If you're a MintPy user looking to crop HyP3 products, please see our [Time Series Analysis with HyP3 and Mintpy Tutorial](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/tutorials/mintpy).

If you are looking for a way to request HyP3 products via Python, we suggest checkout our [HyP3 Python SDK](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk).

If you are looking for workflows that take advantage of our HyP3 on-demand products, we suggest checking out our [ASF Tools](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/asf-tools) Python library.

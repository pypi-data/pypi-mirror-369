# openBIS Command Line Tool (oBIS)

oBIS is a command-line tool that makes it possible to handle data sets tracked by OpenBIS,
where users have complete freedom to structure and manipulate the data as they wish, while retaining
the benefits of openBIS.

With oBIS, it is possible not only to handle datasets stored in OpenBIS but also available to keep
only metadata send to openBIS, while the data itself is managed externally, by the user. In this
case, OpenBIS is aware of its existence and the data can be used for provenance tracking.

## 5. Work modes

oBIS command line tool can work in two modes depending on how data is stored:

1. Standard Data Store mode
2. External Data Store mode

**Warning:** Each repository can work in a single mode only! Mixing modes is not supported.

Depending on the mode, some commands may be unavailable or behave differently. Please read details
in the adequate section.

Here is a short summary of which commands are available in given modes:

**Login**

Some commands like `download` or `upload` will connect to OpenBIS instance. At that time, oBIS will
use username configured in `.obis/config.json` and will ask for password whenever session expires or
username changes.

## 5.1 Standard Data Store

Standard Data Store mode depicts a workflow where datasets are stored directly in the OpenBIS
instance. In this mode user can download/upload files to OpenBIS, search for objects/datasets
fulfilling filtering criteria
and get/set properties of objects/collections represented by datasets in current repository.

## 5.1.1 Commands

**collection**

```
obis collection get [key1] [key2] ...
obis collection set [key1]=[value1], [key2]=[value2] ...
```

With `collection` command, obis crawls through current repository and gathers all data set ids and
then - if
data set is connected directly to a collection - gets or sets given properties to it in OpenBIS

*Note some property names may require to be encapsulated in '', e.g. '$name'*

**config**

```
obis config get [key]
obis config set [key]=[value]
```

With `config` command, obis can get/set config of a local repository, e.g. when setting access link
to OpenBIS instance

The settings are saved within the obis repository, in the `.obis` folder, as JSON files, or
in `~/.obis` for the global settings. They can be added/edited manually, which might be useful when
it comes to integration with other tools.

**Example `.obis/config.json`**

```
{
    "fileservice_url": null,
    "git_annex_hash_as_checksum": true,
    "hostname": "bsse-bs-dock-5-160.ethz.ch",
    "is_physical": true,
    "openbis_url": "http://localhost:8888"
}
```

**data_set**

  --help                          Show this message and exit.

```

With `data_set search` command, obis connects to a configured OpenBIS instance and searches for all
data sets that fulfill given filtering criteria or by using object identification string.
At least one search option must be specified. 

Search results can be downloaded into a file by using `save` option.

Recursive option enables searching for datasets of children samples or datasets

-object* filtering parameters allows to search for datasets owned by objects specified by these params, 
i.e. obis will find objects fitting these criterias (as if it was an `object search` command) and then it will extract 
dataset data.

*Note: Filtering by `-project` may not work when `Project Samples` are disabled in OpenBIS
configuration.*

**download**

```
obis download [options] [data_set_id]

Options:
  -from-file, --from-file TEXT  An output .CSV file from `obis data_set search`
                                command with the list of objects to download
                                data sets from
  -f, --file TEXT               File in the data set to download - downloading
                                all if not given.
  -s, --skip_integrity_check    Flag to skip file integrity check with
                                checksums
```

The `download` command downloads, the files of a given data set from the OpenBIS instance specified
in `config`. This command requires the DownloadHandler / FileInfoHandler microservices to be running
and the `fileservice_url` needs to be configured.

**init**

```
obis init -p [folder]
```

If a folder is given, obis will initialize that folder as an obis repository that works in the
Standard Data Store mode.
If not, it will use the current folder.

**object get / set**

```
obis collection get [key1] [key2] ...
obis collection set [key1]=[value1], [key2]=[value2] ...
```

With `get` and `set` commands, obis crawls through current repository and gathers all data set ids
and then - if
data set is connected directly to an object - gets or sets given properties to it in OpenBIS

*Note some property names may require to be encapsulated in '', e.g. '$name'*

**object search**

```
obis object search [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -space, --space TEXT            Space code
  -project, --project TEXT        Full project identification code
  -collection, --collection TEXT  Full collection code
  -object, --object TEXT          Object identification information, it can be
                                  permId or identifier
  -type, --type TEXT              Type code
  -property TEXT                  Property code
  -property-value TEXT            Property value
  -registration-date, --registration-date TEXT
                                  Registration date, it can be in the format
                                  "oYYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. ">2023-01-01")
  -modification-date, --modification-date TEXT
                                  Modification date, it can be in the format
                                  "oYYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. ">2023-01-01")
  -save, --save TEXT              Filename to save results
  -r, --recursive                 Search data recursively

```

With `object search` command, obis connects to a configured OpenBIS instance and searches for all
objects/samples that fulfill given filtering criteria or by using object identification string.
At least one search option must be specified. 

Search results can be downloaded into a file by using `save` option.

Recursive option enables searching for datasets of children samples or datasets

*Note: Filtering by `-project` may not work when `Project Samples` are disabled in OpenBIS
configuration.*

**upload**

```
obis upload [sample_id] [data_set_type] [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --file     TEXT        File to be used for the upload. Can be used multiple times.
  -p, --property KEY=VALUE   Key-value pair to be set in dataset properties. Can be used multiple times.
```

With `upload` command, a new data set of type `data_set_type` will be created under
object `sample_id`. Files and folders specified with `-f` flag will be uploaded to a newly created
data set.

### 5.1.2 Examples

**Create an obis repository to work in Standard Data Store mode**

```
# global settings to be use for all obis repositories
obis config -g set openbis_url=https://localhost:8888
obis config -g set user=admin
# create an obis repository with a folder name
obis init -p data1
cd data1
# check configuration
obis config get is_physical
# search for objects of type BACTERIA in sapce TESTID  in OpenBIS
obis object search -space TESTID -type BACTERIA
# save search results in a files
obis object search -space TESTID -type BACTERIA -save results.csv
obis object search -space TESTID -save results_space.csv
# upload files to an existing object as type RAW_DATA
obis upload 20230228133001314-59 RAW_DATA -f results.csv -f results_space.csv -p \$name='some dataset'
obis upload 20230228133001314-59 RAW_DATA -f results.csv -f results_space.csv -p '$name'='another dataset'
```

**download datasets of an object and check properties**

```
# assuming we are in a configured obis repository
obis download 20230228091119011-58
# set object name to XYZ
obis object set '$name'=XYZ
# set children of an object to /TESTID/PROJECT_101/PROJECT_101_EXP_3
obis object set children=/TESTID/PROJECT_101/PROJECT_101_EXP_3
```

## 5.2 External Data Store

External Data Store mode allows for orderly management of data in
conditions that require great flexibility. oBIS makes it possible to track data on a file system,
where users have complete freedom to structure and manipulate the data as they wish, while retaining
the benefits of openBIS. With oBIS, only metadata is actually stored and managed by openBIS. The
data itself is managed externally, by the user, but openBIS is aware of its existence and the data
can be used for provenance tracking.

Under the covers, obis takes advantage of publicly available and tested tools to manage data on the
file system. In particular, it uses git and git-annex to track the content of a dataset. Using
git-annex, even large binary artifacts can be tracked efficiently. For communication with openBIS,
obis uses the openBIS API, which offers the power to register and track all metadata supported by
openBIS.

### 5.2.1 Settings

With `get` you retrieve one or more settings. If the `key` is omitted, you retrieve all settings of
the `type`:

```
obis [type] [options] get [key]
```

With `set` you set one or more settings:

```
obis [type] [options] set [key1]=[value1], [key2]=[value2], ...
```

With `clear` you unset one or more settings:

```
obis [type] [options] clear [key1]
```

With the type `settings` you can get all settings at once:

```
obis settings [options] get
```

The option `-g` can be used to interact with the global settings. The global settings are stored
in `~/.obis` and are copied to an obis repository when that is created.

Following settings exist:

| type       | setting                      | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| collection |  `id`                        | Identifier of the collection the created data set is attached to.

The settings are saved within the obis repository, in the `.obis` folder, as JSON files, or
in `~/.obis` for the global settings. They can be added/edited manually, which might be useful when
it comes to integration with other tools.

**Example `.obis/config.json`**

```
{
    "fileservice_url": null,
    "git_annex_hash_as_checksum": true,
    "hostname": "bsse-bs-dock-5-160.ethz.ch",
    "openbis_url": "http://localhost:8888"
}
```

**Example `.obis/data_set.json`**

```
{
    "properties": {
        "K1": "v1",
        "K2": "v2"
    },
    "type": "UNKNOWN"
}
```

## 5.2.2 Commands

**init**

```
obis init [folder]
```

If a folder is given, obis will initialize that folder as an obis in the External Data Store mode.
If not, it will use the current folder.

**init_analysis**

```
obis init_analysis [options] [folder]
```

With init_analysis, a repository can be created which is derived from a parent repository. If it is
called from within a repository, that will be used as a parent. If not, the parent has to be given
with the `-p` option.

**commit**

```
obis commit [options]
```

The `commit` command adds files to a new data set in openBIS. If the `-m` option is not used to
define a commit message, the user will be asked to provide one.

**sync**

```
obis sync
```

When git commits have been done manually, the `sync` command creates the corresponding data set in
openBIS. Note that, when interacting with git directly, use the git annex commands whenever
applicable, e.g. use "git annex add" instead of "git add".

**status**

```
obis status [folder]
```

This shows the status of the repository folder from which it is invoked, or the one given as a
parameter. It shows file changes and whether the repository needs to be synchronized with openBIS.

**clone**

```
obis clone [options] [data_set_id]
```

The `clone` command copies a repository associated with a data set and registers the new copy in
openBIS. In case there are already multiple copied of the repository, obis will ask from which copy
to clone.

- To avoid user interaction, the copy index can be chosen with the option `-c`
- With the option `-u` a user can be defined for copying the files from a remote system
- By default, the file integrity is checked by calculating the checksum. This can be skipped
  with `-s`.

_Note_: This command does not work when `obis_metadata_folder` is set.

**move**

```
obis move [options] [data_set_id]
```

The `move` command works the same as `clone`, except that the old repository will be removed.

Note: This command does not work when `obis_metadata_folder` is set.

**addref / removeref**

```
obis addref
obis removeref
```

Obis repository folders can be added or removed from openBIS. This can be useful when a repository
was moved or copied without using the `move` or `copy` commands.

**token**


```
obis token get <session_name> [--validity-days] [--validity-weeks] [--validity-months]
```

Gets or creates a new personal access token (PAT) and stores it in the obis configuration. If
no `session_name` is provided or is not stored in the configuration, you'll be asked interactively.
If no validity period is provided, the maximum (configured by the server) is used. If a PAT with
this `session_name` already exists and it is going to expire soon (according to server
setting `personal_access_tokens_validity_warning_period`), a new PAT will be created, stored in the
obis configuration and used for every subsequent request.

### 5.2.3 Examples

**Create an obis repository and commit to openBIS**

```
# global settings to be use for all obis repositories
obis config -g set openbis_url=https://localhost:8888
obis config -g set user=admin
# create an obis repository with a file
obis init data1
cd data1
echo content >> example_file
# configure the repository
obis data_set set type=UNKNOWN
obis object set id=/DEFAULT/DEFAULT
# commit to openBIS
obis commit -m 'message'
```

**Commit to git and sync manually**

```
# assuming we are in a configured obis repository
echo content >> example_file
git annex add example_file
git commit -m 'message'
obis sync
```

**Create an analysis repository**

```
# assuming we have a repository 'data1'
obis init_analysis -p data1 analysis1
cd analysis1
obis data_set set type=UNKNOWN
obis object set id=/DEFAULT/DEFAULT
echo content >> example_file
obis commit -m 'message'
```

## 6. Authentication

There are 2 ways to perform user authentication against OpenBIS.

### 6.1. Login
Obis, internally, stores a session token which is used to connect with OpenBIS. Whenever this token 
is invalidated, obis will ask user to provide credentials to log into OpenBIS again.   


### 6.2. Personal Access Token
Session token is short-lived and its interactive generation makes it unfeasible for usage in automatic 
scripts. An alternative way to authorize is to generate personal access token (PAT), which can be 
configured to last for a long periods of time.

PAT generation is explained in depth in `token` command section.


## 7. Big Data Link Services

The Big Data Link Services can be used to download files which are contained in an obis repository.
The services are included in the installation folder of openBIS,
under `servers/big_data_link_services`. For how to configure and run them, consult
the [README.md](https://sissource.ethz.ch/sispub/openbis/blob/master/big_data_link_server/README.md)
file.

## 8. Rationale for obis

Data-provenance tracking tools like openBIS make it possible to understand and follow the research
process. What was studied, what data was acquired and how, how was data analyzed to arrive at final
results for publication -- this is information that is captured in openBIS. In the standard usage
scenario, openBIS stores and manages data directly. This has the advantage that openBIS acts as a
gatekeeper to the data, making it easy to keep backups or enforce access restrictions, etc. However,
this way of working is not a good solution for all situations.

Some research groups work with large amounts of data (e.g., multiple TB), which makes it inefficient
and impractical to give openBIS control of the data. Other research groups require that data be
stored on a shared file system under a well-defined directory structure, be it for historical
reasons or because of the tools they use. In this case as well, it is difficult to give openBIS full
control of the data.

For situations like these, we have developed `obis`, a tool for orderly management of data in
conditions that require great flexibility. `obis` makes it possible to track data on a file system,
where users have complete freedom to structure and manipulate the data as they wish, while retaining
the benefits of openBIS. With `obis`, only metadata is actually stored and managed by openBIS. The
data itself is managed externally, by the user, but openBIS is aware of its existence and the data
can be used for provenance tracking. `obis` is packaged as a stand-alone utility, which, to be
available, only needs to be added to the `PATH` variable in a UNIX or UNIX-like environment.

Under the covers, `obis` takes advantage of publicly available and tested tools to manage data on
the file system. In particular, it uses `git` and `git-annex` to track the content of a dataset.
Using `git-annex`, even large binary artifacts can be tracked efficiently. For communication with
openBIS, `obis` uses the openBIS API, which offers the power to register and track all metadata
supported by openBIS.

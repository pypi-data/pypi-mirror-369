    Note that reflectance data values are scaled such that 100%=1.0.

    Direct (aka Regular) transmittance -  The amount of light transmitted directly through a material in a parallel manner, ignoring light that is "diffused" within the material. Measurement in a typical sphere instrument is made by placing the material in the transmission compartment with the material mounted against the back wall (adjacent to the lens).  Total transmittance - The total amount of light transmitted through a material including both direct and diffused light. Measurement in a typical sphere instrument is made by placing the material in the transmission compartment with the material mounted against the sphere opening (front wall) and away from the lens.  When measuring materials that adhere to beers law (ex: true solutions), both methods yield equal results. However, when measuring materials that are more diffuse in nature (including suspensions and hazy materials), the amount of difference between the two methods is a characterization of the amount of haze or diffusion of the material.  Many industrial methods exist which require both types of data in order to perform calculations with  (ex: ASTM D1003, procedure B - Standard Test method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance or Transparent Plastics). When the CxF file contains NO spectral data (only colorimetric values such as RGB, XYZ, or CIELab), then use "Colorimetric_Reflectance, Colorimetric_Transmittance, or Colorimetric_Emissive) to indicate that no spectral data is provided.

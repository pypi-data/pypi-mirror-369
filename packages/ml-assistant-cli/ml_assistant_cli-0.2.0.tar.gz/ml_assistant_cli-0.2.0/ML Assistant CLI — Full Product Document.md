# ML Assistant CLI — Full Product Document

Date: August 12, 2025

## Overview

ML Assistant CLI is a single, developer-first command-line tool that takes a project from raw dataset to a deployed, monitored API endpoint with a few simple commands, combining preprocessing, training, evaluation, packaging, deployment, monitoring, and rollback into one cohesive experience, with AI-guided suggestions along the way. It packages models as BentoML services for portability and integrates with cloud providers for managed online endpoints and traffic-safe rollouts.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

## Problem and Vision

ML workflows are fragmented across many tools for data prep, model training, packaging, and deployment, creating friction and steep learning curves for beginners and practitioners; ML Assistant CLI unifies this lifecycle under one opinionated, easy CLI with reproducible artifacts and multi-cloud deployment paths.[^3][^4][^6]

## User Personas

- Beginner ML student: wants local-first learning, sensible defaults, clear hints, and optional local serving.[^6]
- Applied ML engineer: needs quick dataset→endpoint, packaging, one-command deploy, logs, and simple rollback.[^2][^4][^3]
- MLOps/platform engineer: needs standardized packaging, versioning, CI/CD-friendly CLI, and cloud governance alignment.[^4][^7][^5][^1][^2]


## Key Capabilities

- End-to-end workflow in one CLI: init, preprocess, train, evaluate, suggest, predict, package, deploy, monitor, rollback.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
- AI-guided hints: data quality warnings and simple rules for class imbalance, overfitting, and hyperparameter nudge points (local heuristics).
- Packaging via BentoML: build and version Bento artifacts and OCI images automatically for portability and reproducibility.[^8][^3][^1]
- Cloud integrations:
    - BentoCloud: bentoml deploy with scaling, instance type, rollout strategy, env/secrets, and wait/timeout controls.[^9][^2]
    - Azure ML: managed online endpoints with SDK v2/CLI, blue/green deployments, traffic split, local Docker testing, and rollback by traffic mapping.[^5][^4]
    - AWS SageMaker HyperPod: HyperPod CLI to connect clusters, submit jobs, retrieve logs; used for training and orchestrated deployments in AWS-managed infra.[^7][^10][^11]


## Architecture

- CLI core (Python/Typer/Click): orchestrates data, model, evaluation, packaging, provider modules, and a local state/registry file.
- Data/Model/Eval modules: pandas/sklearn/XGBoost pipeline with metrics reports and suggestions.
- Packaging module: generates Bento service scaffold and invokes bento build; produces Bento tag and image for local or cloud use.[^3][^8][^1]
- Providers module:
    - BentoCloud: wraps bentoml cloud login/deploy; supports config file/flags, scaling, instance types, rollout strategies, env/secrets, and logs/status.[^12][^2][^9]
    - Azure ML: wraps Python SDK v2 and az ml for online endpoints, deployments, scaling, traffic, logs, and local Docker testing with --local.[^4][^5]
    - HyperPod: wraps HyperPod CLI for cluster connect, job submit, logs, and environment management on EKS-backed clusters.[^10][^11][^7]
- State and rollback: local registry mapping model versions→Bento tags/images→endpoints and traffic allocations for simple rollbacks using provider-native mechanisms.[^2][^5][^4]


## User Flows

- Local flow
    - mlcli init → preprocess → train → evaluate → suggest → predict → package for local Bento serving.[^6][^1][^3]
- Cloud flow (BentoCloud)
    - mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=bentocloud → mlcli monitor → mlcli rollback, leveraging bentoml deploy flags for scaling/strategy/env/secrets and wait/timeout.[^9][^2][^3]
- Cloud flow (Azure ML)
    - mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=azureml (create endpoint, first deployment, 100% traffic) → monitor logs → optional second deployment and traffic split; rollback by restoring traffic mapping.[^5][^4]
- Cloud flow (AWS HyperPod)
    - Prereqs: HyperPod CLI installed and cluster connected → mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=hyperpod (submit job/deploy) → monitor logs and describe; redeploy prior image/config to roll back.[^13][^11][^7][^10]


## MVP (College — Local Only)

- Scope: init, preprocess, train, evaluate, predict, suggest; local artifacts (model.pkl, metrics.json, pipeline.yaml, data_profile.json) and optional Bento local serving via bento build/serve.[^8][^1][^6]
- Technicals:
    - CLI: Python + Typer/Click with simple config files.
    - Preprocess: schema inference, missing value handling, encoding, scaling; data profile output.
    - Train: logistic regression, random forest, optional XGBoost; light grid/random search.
    - Evaluate: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, confusion matrix; next-steps hints.
    - Package: generate a Bento service and run bento build for consistent local serving.[^1][^8]


## Cloud-Enabled MVP

- Goal: extend local MVP with one-click deploy to a primary provider (BentoCloud recommended for speed) with monitor/rollback.[^2][^3][^9]
- Features:
    - package: produce Bento with tag/version suitable for cloud deployment.[^3][^1]
    - deploy: call provider CLI/SDK; return endpoint URL/status; accept scaling/instance/strategy/env/secrets via flags or config file.[^9][^4][^5][^2]
    - monitor: provider logs/status wrappers.[^12][^7][^10][^4][^5]
    - rollback: bind to provider-native traffic/version semantics (BentoCloud strategies, Azure traffic mapping, HyperPod redeploy).[^7][^10][^4][^5][^2]
- Why BentoCloud first: single bentoml deploy command handles build→push→deploy automatically, with real-time status and robust config options.[^2][^3][^9]


## Full Product (Multi-Cloud, Production-grade)

- Multi-provider abstraction: BentoCloud, Azure ML managed online endpoints, AWS SageMaker HyperPod; consistent CLI UX across providers.[^10][^4][^7][^2]
- Advanced deployment:
    - Config-driven deploys via YAML/JSON files, secrets and env injection, rollout strategies (rolling, recreate, controlled), min/max replicas, instance types.[^4][^5][^9][^2]
    - Traffic management and safe rollouts (blue/green, canary) with explicit traffic split adjustments and rollback.[^5][^9][^4][^2]
- Governance and security:
    - Auth flows: bentoml cloud login; Azure ML workspace auth via SDK/az; AWS IAM and HyperPod cluster context.[^7][^10][^4][^2]
    - Secrets: pass via BentoCloud flags/config or Azure Key Vault/managed identity; ensure least-privilege IAM on AWS.[^9][^4][^7]
- Observability:
    - Logs and status via provider CLIs/APIs: bentoml cloud describe/logs; az ml online-deployment logs/show; hyperpod get-log.[^12][^10][^4][^7]
    - Local dev: Azure’s --local flag to run endpoints in Docker for rapid testing before cloud promote.[^5]
- CI/CD readiness:
    - Non-interactive deployments with config files and tokens; environment checks; version pinning for Bento builds; reproducible deploy specs.[^4][^2][^9]


## Command Surface

- init: scaffold project directories and config.
- preprocess: clean/encode/scale; emit data_profile.json.
- train: train baseline models with basic HPO; save model.pkl and training summary.
- evaluate: compute metrics and diagnostics; save metrics.json.
- predict: batch CSV predictions to predictions.csv.
- suggest: rule-based guidance for improvements.
- package: generate Bento service and bento build for versioned Bento tag/image.[^8][^1]
- deploy:
    - bentocloud: bentoml deploy with name, cluster, scaling, instance type, strategy, env, secrets, wait/timeout, and config dict/file.[^2][^9]
    - azureml: create endpoint and ManagedOnlineDeployment via SDK v2/CLI; set traffic; support local Docker test with --local; scale and split traffic.[^4][^5]
    - hyperpod: connect cluster and submit deploy/training job; inspect logs and status; manage lifecycle via HyperPod CLI.[^11][^10][^7]
- monitor: tail provider logs/status and print quick diagnostics.[^10][^12][^7][^4]
- rollback: switch traffic/version per provider (BentoCloud strategy/previous Bento; Azure traffic map; HyperPod redeploy).[^7][^10][^5][^2][^4]


## Example Commands

- Local:
    - mlcli init → mlcli preprocess --input data.csv → mlcli train --model random_forest → mlcli evaluate --test test.csv → mlcli suggest → mlcli predict --input new.csv --output predictions.csv.[^6]
    - mlcli package → serve locally with Bento using bento build/serve.[^1][^3][^8]
- BentoCloud:
    - mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=bentocloud --name my-svc --scaling-min 1 --scaling-max 3 --instance-type cpu.2 --strategy RollingUpdate --wait → mlcli monitor → mlcli rollback --version v1.[^3][^9][^2]
- Azure ML:
    - mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=azureml (create endpoint, blue deployment, 100% traffic) → mlcli monitor → mlcli deploy --provider=azureml --slot green and traffic-split 10/90 → mlcli rollback to blue.[^5][^4]
- HyperPod:
    - hyperpod connect-cluster … → mlcli package → mlcli deploy --provider=hyperpod → mlcli monitor (get logs, list pods) → mlcli rollback by redeploying previous image.[^11][^10][^7]


## Technical Execution Plan

- Phase 1 (Local MVP): implement core commands and artifacts; Bento packaging and local serve; one tutorial; environment checks.[^6][^8][^1]
- Phase 2 (Cloud MVP — BentoCloud): add deploy/monitor/rollback with bentoml deploy and config file support; emit endpoint URL and curl example.[^3][^9][^2]
- Phase 3 (Full Product): add Azure ML and HyperPod backends with parity features (traffic split, logs, local test), CI-friendly non-interactive flows, and stateful rollbacks.[^10][^7][^4][^5]


## Risks and Mitigations

- Auth/config friction: add preflight checks for tokens, workspace, cluster; clear error messages with remediation steps.[^7][^10][^2][^4]
- Packaging drift: standard Bento service templates, version pinning, and capture deploy args into tracked config files for reproducibility.[^8][^1][^9]
- Rollback complexity: local registry to map versions→deployments; provider-native traffic/version rollbacks to keep operations safe and fast.[^2][^4][^5]
- Provider changes: isolate provider adapters and maintain contract tests against CLIs/SDKs.[^10][^4][^7][^2]


## What Makes It Stand Out

An opinionated CLI that unifies the full ML lifecycle with AI-guided help, reproducible Bento packaging, and first-class multi-cloud deployment integrations, delivering beginner-friendly UX and production-ready rollouts with traffic control and logs from day one.[^1][^6][^8][^3][^4][^7][^5][^2]

Scirpy is a package to analyse T cell receptor (TCR) or B cell receptor (BCR)
repertoires from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in Python.
It seamlessly integrates with [scanpy][] and [mudata][] and provides various modules for data import, analysis and visualization.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

- [Tutorial][link-tutorial], and the
- [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install scirpy:

1. Install the latest release of `scirpy` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scirpy/):

    ```bash
    pip install scirpy
    ```

2. Get it from [Bioconda][link-bioconda]:

    First **setup conda channels [as described here](https://bioconda.github.io/#usage)**. Then install scirpy:

    ```bash
    conda install scirpy
    ```

3. Install the latest development version:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/scverse/scirpy.git@main
    ```

4. Run it in a container using [Docker][] or [Podman][]:

    ```bash
    docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/scirpy:<tag>
    ```

where `tag` is one of [these tags](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/scirpy?tab=tags).

## Release notes

See the [changelog][changelog].

## Support and Contact

We are happy to assist with problems when using scirpy.

- If you need help with scirpy or have questions regarding single-cell immune-cell receptor analysis in general, please join us in the [scverse discourse][scverse-discourse].
- For bug report or feature requests, please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].

We try to respond within two working days, however fixing bugs or implementing new features
can take substantially longer, depending on the availability of our developers.

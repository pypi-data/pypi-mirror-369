      GPT-4 used for simple task. Cost optimization opportunities:
      - Use gpt-4o-mini (90% cheaper, similar quality for simple tasks)
      - Use gpt-3.5-turbo for classification, extraction, summaries <500 tokens
      - Reserve GPT-4 for complex reasoning, code generation, creative tasks

    suggestion: |
      Claude Opus used for basic task. More efficient alternatives:
      - Use Claude Haiku for simple tasks (50x cheaper)
      - Use Claude Sonnet for moderate complexity
      - Reserve Opus for complex analysis and reasoning

    severity: medium
    suggestion: |
      Expensive model used for structured extraction task.
      Cheaper alternatives:
      - Use gpt-4o-mini for keyword extraction
      - Use Claude Haiku for entity recognition
      - Consider fine-tuned smaller models for repeated tasks

    action: warn
    severity: medium
    suggestion: |
      Expensive model used for basic translation.
      Cost-effective options:
      - Use gpt-3.5-turbo for common language pairs
      - Use specialized translation APIs (Google Translate, DeepL)
      - Reserve premium models for nuanced/creative translation

      input.content_length: "<5000"  # characters
    action: warn
    severity: medium
    suggestion: |
      Premium model used for basic summarization.
      Efficient alternatives:
      - Use gpt-4o-mini for summaries under 10k characters
      - Use Claude Haiku for bullet point summaries
      - Consider abstractive vs extractive summarization needs

    action: fail
    severity: high
    suggestion: |
      Expensive model used for binary validation task.
      Much cheaper alternatives:
      - Use gpt-4o-mini for yes/no questions
      - Use classification endpoints
      - Implement rule-based validation where possible

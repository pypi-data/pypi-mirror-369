# Pull Request Summary Generation

Analyze the provided diff to generate a pull request summary that is clear, informative, and natural-sounding. The goal is to create a description that is genuinely helpful and easy to read for both technical and non-technical team members.

## Structure of the Summary

**Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title that captures the essence of the changes.

**Overview**: Start with a high-level paragraph that explains the purpose and context of the changes. This should answer the "why" behind the pull request, providing the reader with immediate understanding of the goal.

**What This Means for Users**: If applicable, dedicate a section to describe any changes that directly affect end-users. This is a critical part of the summary.
- Detail any UI modifications, new features they can now use, or changes to existing workflows.
- Explain the benefit of these changes from their perspective.

**A Closer Look at the Changes**: Provide a more detailed look at the technical implementation. Group related changes together to tell a coherent story. Use bullet points for readability, but accompany them with brief narrative descriptions. Potential areas to cover include:
- **Code Refinements & Improvements**: Describe refactoring, performance optimizations, or improvements to code readability or maintainability.
- **New Functionality**: Detail new functions, classes, or components that were added to support the features.
- **Bug Fixes**: Clearly state the bug that was addressed and how the fix resolves it.
- **Dependency Updates**: Note any changes to project dependencies.

## Writing Style & Narrative

The summary should be crafted as a cohesive narrative, not just a dry list of file changes. Connect the dots for the reader, explaining how different pieces of the code work together to achieve the overall goal.

- **Focus on the "Why"**: Always lead with the reasoning behind a change before detailing the implementation.
- **Prioritize the User**: When possible, frame the changes in terms of user benefits or improvements to the user experience.
- **Objective, Not Robotic**: Maintain a professional, objective tone, but avoid sounding mechanical. Let the quality and clarity of the description convey the importance of the work, rather than using exaggerated adjectives like "significant" or "major." The tone should be confident and informative.

## Formatting and Constraints

**CRITICAL**: The final output must be neutral, third-person exposition suitable for direct placement in a GitHub pull request description. Use GitHub-compliant markdown. Avoid conversational language, direct addresses to the reader (e.g., "you will see"), or emoticons. The content must stand alone as professional documentation of the proposed changes.

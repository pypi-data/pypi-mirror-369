# JrDev Terminal - An agentic coding toolkit for developers.
![code-fast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5efa7671-c2bd-4343-8338-bb2d482cb02f)

## Key Features

*   **Project Chat** - Persistent conversations with file context.
*   **Smart Project Indexing** - Scans codebase, infers conventions, creates a powerful overview of project and key files (`/init`)
*   **AI Code Generation** - Efficient and structured code agent uses multiple AI models to save on cost and produce better results (`/code`)
*   **Smart Controls** - Only let JrDev make the changes you want. Review code diffs, edit them directly, or reprompt for changes.
*   **Git Integration** - Speed up development with PR summaries, code reviews, and commit messages
*   **Model Flexibility** - Easily add new models on the fly
*   **File Context Control** - Let the agent figure out what files are needed for tasks, or add them to context manually
*   **Real-time Monitoring** - Streaming view of tokens, costs, and ability to cancel anytime

## Installation

Install JrDev directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI):
```bash
pip install jrdev
```

For developers or to get the very latest updates, you can install from the GitHub repository:
```bash
# Install from a cloned repository in editable mode
git clone https://github.com/presstab/jrdev
cd jrdev
pip install -e .

# Alternatively
pip install git+https://github.com/presstab/jrdev.git
```

# Code Generation

JrDev operates within the context of your current working directory. Navigate to your project directory and enter `jrdev`.

## 1. Initialize Project:

If this is your first time using JrDev with this project, initiate the setup process to provide JrDev with a comprehensive overview of your project.

```
> /init
```

## 2. Launch Code Agent

For optimal precision, it is recommended to utilize the `/code` command directly:
```
> /code update the "Save" button in the Settings Dialog to change to disabled if there are no changes to save
```

Or try out the JrDev intent agent, which will process and attempt to understand your natural language input and initiate the appropriate code agent task.
```
> update the "Save" button in the Settings Dialog to change to disabled if there are no changes to save
```

### What About Context?

During the `/init` phase, JrDev gathers essential project context, which is subsequently provided to the coding agent. The agent performs up to three rounds of searching to identify relevant files and additional context.

To manually add your own context to a coding task, use the 'Project Files' window and click '+ Code Ctx' on a file or directory to add it to the code context for the next code task. When a code task is launched, it clears any staged code context.

For a detailed overview of the coding agent, see the [code documentation](docs/code.md).

For a detailed overview of the project context system, see the [project context documentation](docs/project_context.md).

## 3. (optional) Configure Smart Model Switching Profiles

JrDev employs different AI models for various tasks to balance performance and cost. It reserves powerful, expensive models for complex work while utilizing faster, cheaper models for routine tasks.

*   **`advanced_reasoning`**: Uses a top-tier model for critical planning and review to ensure the highest quality output. (Try Sonnet, Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek R1)
*   **`advanced_coding`**: Employs a powerful, specialized model for generating accurate and high-quality code. (Try Sonnet, Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek R1/V3, GPT 4.1)
*   **`intermediate_reasoning`**: A cost-effective model for routine tasks like validating code syntax and summarizing files. (Try Gemini 2.5 Flash, Devstral, DeepSeek V3)
*   **`quick_reasoning`**: A fast, low-cost model for simple corrective actions, like fixing a malformed response. (Try Gemini 2.5 Flash, Devstral, DeepSeek V3)
*   **`intent_router`**: A highly efficient model that interprets natural language commands to quickly route them to the correct tool. (Try Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, o4-mini, GPT 4.1)
*   **`low_cost_search`**: An inexpensive model for broad searches, like finding additional context files, to minimize costs. (Try Gemini 2.5 Flash, Devstral, DeepSeek V3)

These profiles are set to default values according to the provided API key. To customize them, access the "Profiles" button, or input natural language instructions in the terminal field to direct changes.

## ðŸš¨Early Access SoftwareðŸš¨

JrDev is in early development and may undergo rapid changes, including breaking changes and experimental features. This tool can modify your project files, and will prompt for confirmation unless placed in "Accept All" mode. **It is strongly recommended to use version control (e.g., Git) and commit your work before using JrDev.**

# OrcaLib / Orca SDK Shared Folder

Important Note!

- All files in this folder are shared between the OrcaLib and the Orca SDK.
- The script `codegen.py` will copy all files in `orcalib/orcalib/shared` to the folder `orca_sdk/orca_sdk/_shared`.
- Make your edits first in the `orcalib` project, then copy the changes to the `orca_sdk` project.
- Please ensure that files in this folder are compatible with both projects and do not have any orcalib dependencies.

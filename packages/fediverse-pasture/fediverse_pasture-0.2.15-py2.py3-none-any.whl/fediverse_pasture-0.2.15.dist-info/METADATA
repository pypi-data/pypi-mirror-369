# Fediverse Pasture

This python package contains tools to test Fediverse applications. This
package uses [bovine](https://bovine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a lot
of the Fediverse related logic. It should also be noted that the aim here
is to debug issues caused by federation, thus everything involves starting
a webserver and running requests against it.

## Usage

For usage information, see the [documentation](https://funfedi.dev/python_package/).

## Development

Install the necessary dependencies via

```bash
poetry install --with test,dev --all-extras
```

To lint and check code formatting run

```bash
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format .
```

To test the code run

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Releasing

```bash
poetry version $TAG
git commit -a -m "new version"
git push origin main
```

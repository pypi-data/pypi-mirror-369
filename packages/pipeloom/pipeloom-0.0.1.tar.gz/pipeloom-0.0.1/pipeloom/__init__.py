pipeloom
=======

Reusable scaffolding for ETL-style, multi-threaded pipelines with:

- One SQLite writer thread in WAL mode
- Workers publishing progress/results over a Queue
- Rich progress (sticky overall + transient per-task)
- Typer CLI

Top-level exports are provided for convenience so you can do:

    from pipeloom import (
        run_pipeline,
        SQLiteWriter,
        TaskDef,
        MsgTaskStarted,  # or alias: MsgTaskStart
        MsgTaskProgress,
        MsgTaskFinished,
        SENTINEL,
        make_overall_progress,
        make_task_progress,
        preregister_task_bars,
        console,
        logger
    )

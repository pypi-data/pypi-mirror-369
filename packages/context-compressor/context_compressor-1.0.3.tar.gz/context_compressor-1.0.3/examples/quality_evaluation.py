        Machine learning algorithms are computational models that enable computers 
        to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. 
        These algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns in large 
        datasets. Popular algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support 
        vector machines, and neural networks. Deep learning, a subset of machine 
        learning, uses multi-layered neural networks to process complex data such 
        as images, speech, and natural language. The training process involves 
        feeding the algorithm labeled examples so it can learn to make accurate 
        predictions on new, unseen data.

        Sarah walked through the bustling marketplace on a sunny Tuesday morning. 
        The vendors were calling out their prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. 
        She stopped at Mrs. Johnson's stall to buy some apples and oranges for 
        her family's lunch. The elderly woman smiled warmly and gave her an extra 
        apple for free. As Sarah continued her shopping, she met her neighbor Tom 
        who was buying flowers for his wife's birthday. They chatted briefly about 
        the weather and their children's school activities before parting ways. 
        Sarah finished her shopping and headed home with her grocery bags.

        The COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO)

        had reported cases. The pandemic led to widespread lockdowns, travel

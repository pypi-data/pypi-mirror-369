## Data Models

### Core Models
- **Flight**: Complete flight information with segments, pricing, and metadata
- **FlightSegment**: Individual flight leg details
- **Airport**: Airport information with validation
- **Airline**: Airline details
- **SearchParams**: Flight search parameters with validation
- **FlightResult**: Search results with metadata and analysis

### Utility Models
- **PriceCalendar**: Flexible date pricing information
- **TripType**: Enumeration for trip types
- **CabinClass**: Cabin class options

## Development Features

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests with real website access
- Demo mode for reliable testing
- Pytest configuration with async support

### Code Quality
- Black formatting
- Ruff linting
- MyPy type checking
- Pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions ready

### Development Tools
- Makefile with common commands
- UV package manager support
- Virtual environment setup
- Playwright browser management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```python
async with ITAScrapper(use_matrix=True, demo_mode=True) as scrapper:
    result = await scrapper.search_flights(
        origin="JFK", destination="LHR",
        departure_date=date(2024, 6, 15),
        return_date=date(2024, 6, 22)
    )
```

### MCP Integration
```python
mcp = TravelPlannerMCP(use_matrix=True, demo_mode=True)
flights = await mcp.search_flights({
    "origin": "JFK", "destination": "LHR",
    "departure_date": "2024-06-15"
})
```

### Route Comparison
```python
comparison = await mcp.compare_routes({
    "routes": [
        {"origin": "JFK", "destination": "CDG"},
        {"origin": "JFK", "destination": "LHR"}
    ],
    "departure_date": "2024-06-15"
})
```

## Production Considerations

### Demo vs Real Mode
- **Demo Mode**: Returns realistic mock data, perfect for development
- **Real Mode**: Accesses actual websites, requires careful handling

### Website Access Challenges
- Anti-bot measures on travel sites
- Frequent UI changes requiring selector updates
- Rate limiting and IP blocking
- Legal compliance with Terms of Service

### Recommended Approach
1. Use demo mode for development and testing
2. Implement proper rate limiting for production
3. Consider proxy rotation and human-like behavior
4. Monitor for selector changes
5. Respect website ToS and robots.txt

## Benefits for Travel Planning

- Hotel and car rental integration
- Real-time price monitoring
- Advanced filtering options
- Fare rules and restrictions parsing
- API rate limiting with backoff
- Caching layer for performance

### Scalability Considerations
- Distributed scraping architecture
- Database integration for result storage
- API wrapper for web service deployment
- Monitoring and alerting systems

## Conclusion

The ITA Scrapper library provides a robust, modern foundation for flight data extraction and travel planning applications. With its dual-source support, comprehensive data models, and MCP integration capabilities, it's well-suited for both development projects and production travel applications.

The inclusion of demo mode makes it particularly valuable for AI and automation projects where reliable, consistent data is needed for testing and development, while the real-website capabilities provide access to current flight information when properly implemented with appropriate safeguards.

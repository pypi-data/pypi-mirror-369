- `voice_sample.wav` - A voice sample for voice cloning (10-30 seconds recommended)
- `speech_sample.wav` - Speech audio for transcription testing
- `english_speech.wav` - English speech for translation testing
- `noisy_audio.wav` - Audio with background noise for denoising
- `conversation.wav` - Multi-speaker audio for speaker analysis

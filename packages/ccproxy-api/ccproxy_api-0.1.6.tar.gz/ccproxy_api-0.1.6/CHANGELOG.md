## Added OpenAI Codex Provider with Full Proxy Support

### Overview

Implemented comprehensive support for OpenAI Codex CLI integration, enabling users to proxy requests through their OpenAI subscription via the ChatGPT backend API. This feature provides an alternative to the Claude provider while maintaining full compatibility with the existing proxy architecture. The implementation uses the OpenAI Responses API endpoint as documented at https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/get.

### Key Features

**Complete Codex API Proxy**

- Full reverse proxy to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`
- Support for both `/codex/responses` and `/codex/{session_id}/responses` endpoints
- Compatible with Codex CLI 0.21.0 and authentication flow
- Implements OpenAI Responses API protocol

**OAuth PKCE Authentication Flow**

- Implements complete OpenAI OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow matching official Codex CLI
- Local callback server on port 1455 for authorization code exchange
- Token refresh and credential management with persistent storage
- Support for `~/.codex/auth.json` configuration file format

**Intelligent Request/Response Handling**

- Automatic detection and injection of Codex CLI instructions field
- Smart streaming behavior based on user's explicit `stream` parameter
- Session management with flexible session ID handling (auto-generated, persistent, header-forwarded)
- Request transformation preserving Codex CLI identity headers

**Advanced Configuration**

- Environment variable support: `CODEX__BASE_URL`
- Configurable via TOML: `[codex]` section in configuration files
- Debug logging with request/response capture capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Enabled by default

### Technical Implementation

**New Components Added:**

- `ccproxy/auth/openai.py` - OAuth token management and credential storage
- `ccproxy/core/codex_transformers.py` - Request/response transformation for Codex format
- `ccproxy/api/routes/codex.py` - FastAPI routes for Codex endpoints
- `ccproxy/models/detection.py` - Codex CLI detection and header management
- `ccproxy/services/codex_detection_service.py` - Runtime detection of Codex CLI requests

**Enhanced Proxy Service:**

- Extended `ProxyService.handle_codex_request()` with full Codex support
- Intelligent streaming response conversion when user doesn't explicitly request streaming
- Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging
- Error handling with proper OpenAI-compatible error responses

### Streaming Behavior Fix

**Problem Resolved:** Fixed issue where requests without explicit `stream` field were incorrectly returning streaming responses.

**Solution Implemented:**

- When `"stream"` field is missing: Inject `"stream": true` for upstream (Codex requirement) but return JSON response to client
- When `"stream": true` explicitly set: Return streaming response to client
- When `"stream": false` explicitly set: Return JSON response to client
- Smart response conversion: collects streaming data and converts to single JSON response when user didn't request streaming

### Usage Examples

**Basic Request (JSON Response):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/codex/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": [{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Hello!"}]}],
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "store": false
  }'
```

**Streaming Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/codex/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": [{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Hello!"}]}],
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "stream": true,
    "store": false
  }'
```

### Authentication Setup

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
export CODEX__BASE_URL="https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex"
```

**Configuration File (`~/.ccproxy.toml`):**

```toml
[codex]
base_url = "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex"
```

1. Authenticate: Use existing OpenAI credentials or run Codex CLI login
2. Update endpoints: Change from `/v1/messages` to `/codex/responses`

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready OpenAI Codex proxy solution that maintains the same standards as the existing Claude provider while offering users choice in their AI provider preferences.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-08-03

### Added

- **Advanced Session and Pool Management**:
  - Implemented a robust session-aware pool for persistent Claude SDK connections, significantly improving performance and maintaining conversation continuity.
  - Introduced a hybrid pooling system that automatically transfers clients from a general pool to the session pool upon receiving a session ID.
  - Developed a queue-based streaming architecture to efficiently handle and broadcast messages to multiple listeners, improving session management and disconnection handling.
- **Enhanced Observability and Logging**:
  - Upgraded logging capabilities to include detailed session metadata, providing deeper insights into session lifecycle and reuse.
  - Implemented a pool monitoring system to track the health and performance of both general and session-based connection pools.
  - Reduced logging noise by adjusting log levels for operational SDK messages, focusing on essential access logs, warnings, and errors.
- **Improved Configuration and Control**:
  - Introduced a `builtin_permissions` flag to provide granular control over the built-in permission handling infrastructure (MCP and SSE).
  - Implemented configurable system prompt injection modes (`minimal` and `full`) to customize how the Claude Code identity is presented in requests.
- **Robust Streaming and Header Management**:
  - Implemented `StreamingResponseWithLogging` for unified and consistent access logging across all streaming endpoints.
  - Ensured critical upstream headers (e.g., `cf-ray`, `anthropic-ratelimit-*`) are correctly forwarded in SSE streaming responses.

### Changed

- **Default Behavior**:
  - The Claude SDK connection pool is now disabled by default, requiring an explicit opt-in for safer and more predictable behavior.
- **Architectural Improvements**:
  - Refactored the application's startup and shutdown logic into a modular, component-based architecture for better maintainability and testability.
  - Renamed `SessionContext` to `SessionClient` for improved clarity and consistency in the session pooling implementation.
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Reorganized the entire test suite into a hierarchical structure (`unit` and `integration`) to improve navigation and maintainability.
  - Migrated from legacy test fixtures to a more flexible and maintainable factory pattern for creating test clients and application instances.

### Fixed

- **Session and Streaming Stability**:
  - Eliminated critical race conditions and `AttributeError` exceptions in the session pool and stream handling logic.
  - Replaced fragile `asyncio.sleep` calls with a robust, event-based synchronization mechanism to prevent timing-related failures.
  - Implemented a more accurate message-based stale detection mechanism to prevent the incorrect termination of active sessions.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Corrected several resource leak issues by improving stream interruption handling, ensuring that hanging sessions are properly cleaned up.
- **Header and Content Formatting**:
  - Resolved an issue that prevented the forwarding of upstream headers in SSE streaming responses.
  - Fixed a formatting bug in the OpenAI adapter that caused message content to be improperly concatenated.

### Added

- **Configurable Permission Infrastructure**: Added `builtin_permissions` configuration flag to control built-in permission handling infrastructure:
  - New `builtin_permissions` flag (default: true) in ClaudeSettings for granular control
  - CLI support with `--builtin-permissions/--no-builtin-permissions` options
  - When disabled: No MCP server setup, no SSE permission endpoints, no permission service initialization
  - When enabled: Full built-in permission infrastructure with smart MCP server merging
  - Users can configure custom MCP servers independently when built-in infrastructure is disabled
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing configurations
- **Claude SDK Pool Mode**: Implemented connection pooling for Claude Code SDK clients to improve request performance:
  - Maintains a pool of pre-initialized Claude Code instances to eliminate startup overhead
  - Reduces request latency by reusing established connections
  - Pool mode is disabled by default and can be enabled via configuration
  - **Limitations**: Pool mode does not support dynamic Claude options (max_tokens, model changes, etc.)
  - Pool instances are shared across requests with identical configurations
- **Session-Aware Connection Pooling**: Added advanced session-based pooling for persistent conversation context:
  - Session pools maintain dedicated Claude SDK clients per session ID for conversation continuity
  - Configurable session TTL (time-to-live) with automatic cleanup of idle sessions
  - Session pool settings include max sessions, idle threshold, and cleanup intervals
  - Automatic connection recovery for unhealthy sessions when enabled
  - Session interruption support for graceful handling of canceled requests
  - Separate from the general connection pool - can be used independently or together
  - Configuration via `claude.session_pool` settings with sensible defaults
- **Claude Detection Service**: Implemented automatic Claude CLI header and system prompt detection at startup:
  - Automatically detects current Claude CLI version and extracts real headers/system prompt
  - Caches detection results per version to avoid repeated startup delays
  - Falls back to hardcoded values when detection fails
- **Detection Models**: Added Pydantic models for Claude detection data:
  - `ClaudeCodeHeaders` - Structured header extraction with field aliases
  - `SystemPromptData` - System prompt content with cache control
  - `ClaudeCacheData` - Complete cached detection data with version tracking

### Changed

  - Added `use_client_pool` boolean flag to enable general connection pooling
  - Added `pool_settings` for configuring general pool behavior (size, timeouts, health checks)
  - Added `session_pool` settings for session-aware pooling configuration
  - Session pool enabled by default with 1-hour TTL and automatic cleanup
- **HTTP Request Transformation**: Enhanced request transformers to use detected Claude CLI headers and system prompt:
  - Dynamically uses detected headers when available, falls back to hardcoded when not

## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Conditional Authentication**: API endpoints now support optional authentication - when `SECURITY__AUTH_TOKEN` is configured, authentication is enforced; when not configured, the proxy runs in open mode.
- **Startup Validation**: Added comprehensive validation checks during application startup:
  - Validates OAuth credentials and warns about expired tokens
  - Checks for Claude CLI binary availability with installation instructions
  - Logs token expiration time and subscription type when valid
- **Default Command**: The `serve` command is now the default - running `ccproxy` without subcommands automatically starts the server.
- **Alternative Entry Point**: Added `ccproxy-api` as an alternative command-line entry point.

### Changed

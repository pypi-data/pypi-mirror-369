### Features
- **Text Compression**: Configurable compression ratios from 30% to 70%
- **Quality Assessment**: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, semantic similarity, entity preservation, and readability scoring
- **Query-Aware Processing**: Prioritize content relevant to user queries
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing of multiple texts with statistics
- **Caching**: TTL-based caching with configurable size and cleanup
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom compression strategies
- **Performance Optimized**: 1-4ms processing time per compression
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Technical Details
- **Python Support**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: numpy, scikit-learn, pydantic, typing-extensions
- **Optional Dependencies**: torch, transformers, sentence-transformers, fastapi
- **Architecture**: Strategy pattern with manager-based selection
- **Quality Metrics**: Weighted scoring system with configurable weights
- **Token Counting**: Multiple tokenization strategies including approximation
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe caching implementation

### Performance
- Compression ratios: 11% to 65% depending on target and content
- Quality scores: 0.4 to 0.6 overall quality rating
- Token savings: 86 to 217 tokens on typical inputs
- Processing speed: 1-4ms per text compression
- Batch success rate: 100% on valid inputs

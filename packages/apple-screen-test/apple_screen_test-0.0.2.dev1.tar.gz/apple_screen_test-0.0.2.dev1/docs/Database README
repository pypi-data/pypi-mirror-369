# Database Documentation: screentest

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `screentest` database, its structure, and how to interact with it.

## 1. Purpose & Core Concepts

*   **What this database does:** This database stores information used in the ITMS11 and PROD data sources for testing.

        Example:
         itms11_data_model = Data(
            ACCOUNTS=ACCOUNTS,
            CANVASES=CANVASES,
            COLLECTIONS=COLLECTIONS,
            CONTENT_DATAS=CONTENT_DATAS,
            DIRECT_ACCESS=direct_access,
            OFFERS=OFFERS,
            UTS_OFFERS=UTS_OFFERS,
        )

It serves as the data backbone for the testing data of UTS QA and contains data previously hardcoded into files.

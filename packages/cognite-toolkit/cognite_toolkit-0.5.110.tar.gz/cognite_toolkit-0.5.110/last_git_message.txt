[CDF-25435] ðŸ›‘ Stop-gap solution solution to function queuing problem (#1822)

# Description

This is a stop-gap solution to avoid hammering the function API when the
queue on the server side is full. The issue with the solution is that it
uses private methods in the Cognite-SDK. We will be able to implement a
better solution once the #1737 along with a few PRs stacked on this is
implemented. I have captured the fixing of this in the task

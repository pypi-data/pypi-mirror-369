[1] Set up comprehensive todo list with 15 tasks covering clean uninstall, configuration fixes, publishing, and installation
[2] ISSUE FOUND: Pre-commit hook failed due to missing defusedxml dependency - exactly as predicted in .claude/development/uv-hatch-setup.md. Tests failing with ModuleNotFoundError.
[3] Fixed pyproject.toml: Changed build-backend from setuptools to hatchling, moved defusedxml from project dependencies to dev dependencies
[4] SUCCESS: Added hatch build configuration for src/tunacode packages. Hatch environment recreated successfully with UV as installer and dev dependencies.
[5] Fixed publish script: Removed problematic uv sync --dev command and replaced with proper Hatch dependency management comment
[6] CORRECTION: defusedxml is actually a runtime dependency used in bash tool, not dev-only. Moved it back to main dependencies and recreated environment.
[7] ROOT FIX SUCCESS: Used hatch run uv pip install -e . to force proper dependency installation. defusedxml now available in hatch environment.
[8] Uninstalled existing tunacode installation: removed venv at /root/.tunacode-venv and wrapper script issues resolved
[9] Validation SUCCESS: hatch run lint-check passed - all code formatting and linting checks passed
[10] PUBLISHING SUCCESS: Script successfully validated all tests (298 passed), bumped version to 0.0.62, and proceeding with PyPI upload
[11] ðŸŽ‰ PUBLISHING COMPLETE: tunacode-cli v0.0.62 successfully published to PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/tunacode-cli/0.0.62/
[12] INSTALL SCRIPT IMPROVEMENT: Enhanced detection logic to distinguish between wrapper scripts and actual user installations. Now properly detects: 1) venv+wrapper installs, 2) user site-packages installs, 3) system installs

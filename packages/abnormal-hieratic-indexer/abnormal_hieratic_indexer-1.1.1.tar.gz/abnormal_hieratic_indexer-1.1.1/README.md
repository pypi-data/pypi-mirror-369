# Abnormal Hieratic Indexer

Script that indexes annotations in the [Abnormal Hieratic Global Portal][ahgp].
This script is specifically tailored towards the annotations created for the AHGP.

Annotations in the AHGP are stored in a [Simple Annotation Server][sas],
but for search we use [Elasticsearch][es].

[es]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/

## Installation

This script was developed with Python 3.9. It may run on other versions, but tests are very limited.

To install, run `pip install abnormal-hieratic-indexer` in your environment.

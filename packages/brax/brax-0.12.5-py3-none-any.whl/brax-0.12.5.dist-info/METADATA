                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Brax is a fast and fully differentiable physics engine used for research and
development of robotics, human perception, materials science, reinforcement
learning, and other simulation-heavy applications.

Brax is written in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and is designed for use
on acceleration hardware. It is both efficient for single-device simulation, and
scalable to massively parallel simulation on multiple devices, without the need
for pesky datacenters.

Brax simulates environments at millions of physics steps per second on TPU, and includes a suite of learning algorithms that train agents in seconds
to minutes:

*   Baseline learning algorithms such as
    [PPO](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/training/agents/ppo),
    [SAC](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/training/agents/sac),
    [ARS](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/training/agents/ars), and
    [evolutionary strategies](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/training/agents/es).
*   Learning algorithms that leverage the differentiability of the simulator, such as [analytic policy gradients](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/training/agents/apg).

## One API, Four Pipelines

Brax offers four distinct physics pipelines that are easy to swap:

* [MuJoCo XLA - MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html) - a JAX
reimplementation of the MuJoCo physics engine.
* [Generalized](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/generalized/)
calculates motion in [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates)
using dynamics algorithms similar to [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) and [TDS](https://github.com/erwincoumans/tiny-differentiable-simulator).
* [Positional](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/positional/)
uses [Position Based Dynamics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf),
a fast but stable method of resolving joint and collision constraints.
* [Spring](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/brax/spring/) provides
fast and cheap simulation for rapid experimentation, using simple impulse-based
methods often found in video games.

These pipelines share the same API and can run side-by-side within the same
simulation.  This makes Brax well suited for experiments in transfer learning
and closing the gap between simulation and the real world.

## Quickstart: Colab in the Cloud

Explore Brax easily and quickly through a series of colab notebooks:

* [Brax Basics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/brax/blob/main/notebooks/basics.ipynb) introduces the Brax API, and shows how to simulate basic physics primitives.
* [Brax Training](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/brax/blob/main/notebooks/training.ipynb) introduces Brax's training algorithms, and lets you train your own policies directly within the colab. It also demonstrates loading and saving policies.
* [Brax Training with MuJoCo XLA - MJX](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/mjx/tutorial.ipynb) demonstrates training in Brax using the `MJX` physics simulator.
* [Brax Training with PyTorch on GPU](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/brax/blob/main/notebooks/training_torch.ipynb) demonstrates how Brax can be used in other ML frameworks for fast training, in this case PyTorch.

## Using Brax Locally

To install Brax from pypi, install it with:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install brax
```

You may also install from [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba):

```
conda install -c conda-forge brax  # s/conda/mamba for mamba
```

Alternatively, to install Brax from source, clone this repo, `cd` to it, and then:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

To train a model:

```
learn
```

Training on NVidia GPU is supported, but you must first install
[CUDA, CuDNN, and JAX with GPU support](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

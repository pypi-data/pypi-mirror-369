## Release Process

### Creating a New Release

Use the release script for semantic versioning:

```bash
# Patch release (0.1.0 â†’ 0.1.1)
python scripts/release.py --type patch

# Minor release (0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0)
python scripts/release.py --type minor

# Major release (0.1.0 â†’ 1.0.0)
python scripts/release.py --type major

# Specific version
python scripts/release.py --version 1.2.3

# Dry run to see what would happen
python scripts/release.py --type patch --dry-run
```

### Release Workflow

1. **Prepare Release**: Ensure all changes are committed and tested
2. **Run Release Script**: Updates version, creates commit and tag
3. **Push to GitHub**: Script asks if you want to push automatically
4. **GitHub Actions**: Automatically builds, tests, and publishes to PyPI
5. **Monitor**: Check GitHub Actions workflow for successful publish

### Testing Releases

Test releases on TestPyPI before production:

```bash
# Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
# Or automatic on PRs that modify publishing-related files
```

### Post-Release Steps

After PyPI publishing:
1. Configure Trusted Publishing on PyPI (first release only)
2. Monitor package availability: https://pypi.org/project/pltr-cli/
3. Test installation: `pip install pltr-cli`

# Tasklin

Tasklin is a versatile Python CLI for leveraging multiple AI providers like OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic (Claude), and more. It’s designed for developers and creators who want to integrate AI into their workflows, pipelines, or automation, without being limited to “chatting” with AI.

Use it to generate text, process data, or build AI-driven scripts, all directly from your terminal.
---

## Features

* Single CLI to interact with multiple AI providers
* Supports **OpenAI**, **Ollama**, **Anthropic(Claude)**, **DeepSeek** and more in the future
* Returns structured responses with tokens used and execution time
* Supports **sync** and **async** execution
* Clean error handling for missing models, invalid API keys, etc.
* Available on **PyPI** as `tasklin`

---

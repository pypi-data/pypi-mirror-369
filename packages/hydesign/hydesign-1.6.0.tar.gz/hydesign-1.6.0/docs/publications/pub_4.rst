The value of sector coupling for the development of offshore power grids.
==========================================================================

**Abstract**

Offshore grids can play key roles in the transition of energy systems toward sustainability.
Although they require extensive infrastructure investments, they allow for the exploitation of additional resources and may be important in providing for part of the increasing electricity demands
driven by sector coupling. This paper quantifies the socioeconomic value of offshore grids and
identifies their major drivers, performing energy system optimization in a model application of
the northern–central European energy system and the North Sea offshore grid towards 2050. The
increasing wake loss with the sizes of hub-connected wind farms is integrated in the modeling. We
find that without sector coupling no offshore grid may develop, and that the higher the level of sector
coupling, the higher the value of offshore grids. Therefore, it can be strongly stated that offshore
grid infrastructure development should not be discussed as a separate political topic, but seen in
connection to sector coupling

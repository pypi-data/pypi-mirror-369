Synergy of Hydrogen Production in Active Distribution Networks.
================================================================

**Abstract**

Distribution networks worldwide are on the verge of a significant transformation owing to the increasing share of distributed generation connected, especially wind and solar, at medium and low voltage levels. The traditional distribution network infrastructure, designed for uni-directional power flow, is non-optimal to accommodate generation sources, leading to a bi-directional power flow. Hydrogen systems, along with a PV power plant, wind power plant, or battery storage, have been investigated for optimal day-ahead operation, voltage regulation, and active and reactive power flexibility to mitigate the risk due to uncertain and variable renewable generation. A multi-energy framework offers greater flexibility for distribution networks to position themselves as an active participant in future distribution networks. However, as pointed out by many works, the path towards utilizing the full potential of hydrogen cost-effectively will require further research and development effort. This paper thus presents a brief survey of the existing electrolyzer technologies for hydrogen production in terms of their efficiency, operational characteristics and investment costs. The application and utility of hydrogen in future distribution networks are evaluated by studying existing research works and demonstration projects worldwide.

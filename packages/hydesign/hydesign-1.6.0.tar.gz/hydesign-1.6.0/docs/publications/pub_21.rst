Interfacing Energy Management with Supervisory Control for Hybrid Power Plants.
================================================================================

**Abstract**

Variability and uncertainties of wind and solar
bring significant challenges into power system operation and
control. Hybrid power plants (HPPs), which incorporates the
complementary nature of wind and solar together with other
technologies, such as energy storage, is a solution to cope with
these challenges. To maximize the revenue and enable the
operation of HPPs, the energy management system and the
supervisory controller are both needed, namely the HPP EMS
and the HPPC. The HPP EMS provides optimal dispatch
strategies in order to maximize the revenue through market
bids. Meanwhile, the HPPC executes dispatch plans from the
HPP EMS in a real-time fashion. The paper highlights a new
design of HPP EMS and HPPC with a focus on interface design
between the two. The variables exchanged between the HPP
EMS and the HPPC are presented, and practical issues such as
time coordination and robustness over communication failure
are discussed in detail.

North Sea region energy system towards 2050: integrated offshore grid and sector coupling drive offshore wind installations.
=============================================================================================================================

**Abstract**

The North Sea offers high offshore wind power potential. In addition, several
existing and planned transmission lines are located in the region. This paper
models a meshed offshore grid in the North Sea to investigate the viability of
connecting transmission and offshore wind generation investments.
Generation and transmission investments, both onshore and offshore, and
storage, are optimized to reach an integrated offshore grid scenario towards
2050 for the region. For comparison, a project-based scenario, where each
offshore wind power plant is connected individually, is also analysed. The two
scenarios are compared with focus on costs and variable renewable energy
(VRE) shares.
This paper studies also the expected effects of sector coupling in the North
Sea region. Electricity and heating sectors are optimized jointly towards 2050,
with electrification of industry, district heating expansion and electric vehicle
penetration considered. Electrification increases electricity consumption;
however, the heating sector has also potential to provide flexibility to the
system. The results show that sector coupling drives renewable energy
investments higher, with offshore wind capacities significantly increased,
helping Europe towards decarbonizing the whole energy system. Sector
coupling can also provide flexibility to the power system, e.g., in utilizing
heating sector flexibility. However, markets need to be highly integrated to
reach these benefits.

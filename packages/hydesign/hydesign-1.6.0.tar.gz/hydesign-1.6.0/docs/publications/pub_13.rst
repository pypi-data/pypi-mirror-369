Profitability of hybrid power plants in European markets.
==========================================================

**Abstract**

As markets continue to evolve, hybrid power plants (HPPs) are attracting the
interest of plant operators and industry players alike. With their ability to provide flexible
dispatchability, HPPs are poised to become a competitive solution in future energy markets,
particularly in grid ancillary markets (such as frequency control, reactive power control and
black-start). Moreover, resource complementarities present in some sites have the potential to
significantly improve production predictability of collocated HPPs.To assess the profitability of
HPPs in European markets, a hybrid sizing algorithm is applied to three locations across Europe
with distinct resource distribution characteristics. The sizing tool implemented includes several
novel features that are not typically incorporated into existing sizing software currently available
on the market. This includes turbine selection, a simplified physical design of the wind power
plant, a surrogate wake model, and a simplified solar panel degradation model. NPV-overCAPEX optimal plant designs, tend to favor hybridization, by either collocating wind and solar
power with storage, or only solar power with storage. On the hand, minimizing the levelized
cost of energy generally results in single-technology power plants. The results show significant
potential for hybrid power plants in European markets. However, to truly demonstrate their
economic competitiveness, the focus should shift from LCOE to other optimization metrics that
consider revenue from different electricity markets.

Using time series simulation tool for assessing the effects of variable renewable energy generation on power and energy systems.
=================================================================================================================================

**Abstract**

The increasing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation poses challenges to power
systems. Possible challenges include adequacy of reserves, planning and operation of power
systems, and interconnection expansion studies in future power systems with very different
generation patterns compared to today. To meet these challenges, there is a need to develop
models and tools to analyse the variability and uncertainty in VRE generation. To address the varied
needs, the tools should be versatile and applicable to different geographical and temporal scales.
Time series simulation tools can be used to model both today and future scenarios with varying VRE
installations. CorRES (Correlations in Renewable Energy Sources) is a simulation tool developed at
Technical University of Denmark, Department of Wind Energy capable of simulating both wind and
solar generation. It uses a unique combination of meteorological time series and stochastic
simulations to provide consistent VRE generation and forecast error time series with temporal
resolution in the minute scale. Such simulated VRE time series can be used in addressing the
challenges posed by the increasing share of VRE generation. These capabilities will be demonstrated
through three case studies: one about the use of large-scale VRE generation simulations in energy
system analysis, and two about the use of the simulations in power system operation, planning and
analysis.

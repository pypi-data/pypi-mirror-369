HyDesign: A Tool For Design and Operation of Renewable Hybrid Renewable Plants.
================================================================================

**Abstract**

With increasing interests for utility-scale renewable hybrid power plants, there is a definite need for new tools for optimal design and operation of these plants for future demanding energy markets. This paper investigates the available tools which can be useful for design of hybrid power plants and mapping the limitations and gaps for these tools. This paper also demonstrates the features and capabilities of a new open source tool HyDesign developed for design and operation of renewable hybrid power plants.

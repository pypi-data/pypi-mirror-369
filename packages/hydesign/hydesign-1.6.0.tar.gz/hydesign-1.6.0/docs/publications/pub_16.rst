Recommendations for balancing requirements for future North Sea countries towards 2050.
========================================================================================

**Abstract**

This paper summarizes the findings of Danish project - NSON-DK regarding the balancing requirements for future power system of North Sea countries with focus on the Danish power system and its regions DK1 and DK2. The study covers all the steps of the operation from the Day Ahead Market to the Real Time balancing of generation and demand. For that reason, DTU Balancing Tool Chain is used. The paper analyses a) the value of offshore grid on balancing of forecast errors, b) the impact of forecast errors on manual and automatic reserves and c) the quality of electrical frequency in the near future considering high VRE penetration d) value of including wake in the balancing studies with high share of renewables. Recommendations are provided in terms of balancing requirements for future power systems.

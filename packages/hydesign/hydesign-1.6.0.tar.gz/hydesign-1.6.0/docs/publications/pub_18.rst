Component Sizing of an utility scale hybrid power plant.
=========================================================

**Abstract**

A Hybrid Power Plant combining wind and solar
generators with battery energy storage system is analyzed in
this paper. The objective is to determine the rated capacities
of the technologies which yield the maximum revenue stream
while ensuring a feasible investment. Therefore, a mathematical
model to maximize the Net Present Value is implemented which
is applied for a realistic case study of a peak power plant in
India.

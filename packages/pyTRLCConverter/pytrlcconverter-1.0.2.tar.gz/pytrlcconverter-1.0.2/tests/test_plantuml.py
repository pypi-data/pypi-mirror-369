"""
Unit tests for the PlantUML class in the pyTRLCConverter module.

This file contains tests that verify the functionality of the PlantUML class,
including the creation of server URLs for PlantUML diagrams.

Fixtures:
    plantuml_instance: Provides an instance of the PlantUML class with a mocked server URL.

Tests:
    test_make_server_url: Tests the _make_server_url method of the PlantUML class.

    Create an instance of PlantUML with a server URL.

    This function temporarily sets the PLANTUML environment variable to

    Test the _make_server_url method of the PlantUML instance.
    This test verifies that the _make_server_url method correctly generates
    the server URL for a given diagram type and path. It mocks the content
    of the diagram file and checks if the generated URL matches the expected URL.

        plantuml (PlantUML): An instance of the PlantUML class.
    Asserts:
        The generated URL starts with the expected base URL.

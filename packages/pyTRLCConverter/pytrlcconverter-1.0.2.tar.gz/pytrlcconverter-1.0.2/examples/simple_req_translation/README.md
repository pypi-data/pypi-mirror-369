# pyTRLCConverter <!-- omit in toc -->

## Simple Requirement with Translation Example

The example demonstrates how the requirements in a **single file** are converted to Markdown format **without any project specific conversion**, but **with a translation file** to translate the requirement type attribute name. The pyTRLCConverter will generate a simple output without project-specific conversion functions.

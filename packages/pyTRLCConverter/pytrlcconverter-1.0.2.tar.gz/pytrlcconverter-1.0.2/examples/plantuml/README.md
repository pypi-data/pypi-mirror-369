# pyTRLCConverter <!-- omit in toc -->

## Simple Requirement Example With Project Specific Conversion

The example demonstrates how the requirements in a **single file** are converted to Markdown format **with a project specific conversion**. The pyTRLCConverter will generate a simple output without project-specific conversion functions.

The addition is the ```PlantUML``` type, which can convert a **PlantUML diagram** to PNG image and includes it in the Markdown file.

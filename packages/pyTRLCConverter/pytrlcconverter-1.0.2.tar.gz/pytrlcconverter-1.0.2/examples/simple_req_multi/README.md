# pyTRLCConverter <!-- omit in toc -->

## Simple Requirement Example With Multiple Sources
The example demonstrates how requirements in **several files** are converted to Markdown format **without any project specific conversion** and **without a translation file** to translate the requirement type attribute name. The pyTRLCConverter will generate a simple output without project-specific conversion functions. For each source file (\*.trlc) a corresponding output file (\*.md) will be created.

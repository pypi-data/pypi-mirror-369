## Examples

The following examples show different functionality as well as possibilities. Because one part of the innovation is still on the user side, e.g. by introducing a Diagram type and not just deal with requirements.

| Example | Single/Multiple source(s) | With project specific conversion functions | Diagram support | Single output document | Translation |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| [plantuml](./plantuml/) | Single | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| [simple_req](./simple_req/) | Single | No | No | No | No |
| [simple_req_multi](./simple_req_multi/) | Multiple | No | No | No | No |
| [simple_req_multi_single_out](./simple_req_multi_single_out/) | Multiple | No | No | Yes | No |
| [simple_req_proj_spec](./simple_req/) | Single | Yes | No | No | No |
| [simple_req_translation](./simple_req_translation/) | Single | No | No | No | Yes |

Also look into the [tools/ProjectConverter](../tools/ProjectConverter) folder, which contains
more sophisticated converter implementations. These are the converters for the pyTRLCConverter
model files in [trlc/model](../trlc/model/).

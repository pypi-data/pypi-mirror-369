# PyGhidra-MCP - Ghidra Model Context Protocol Server


### Overview

**`pyghidra-mcp`** is a command-line Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that brings the full analytical power of [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), a robust software reverse engineering (SRE) suite, into the world of intelligent agents and LLM-based tooling.
It bridges Ghidra‚Äôs [ProgramAPI](https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/model/listing/Program.html) and [FlatProgramAPI](https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/flatapi/FlatProgramAPI.html) to Python using `pyghidra` and `jpype`, then exposes that functionality via the Model Context Protocol. 

MCP is a unified interface that allows language models, development tools (like VS Code), and autonomous agents to access structured context, invoke tooling, and collaborate intelligently. Think of MCP as the bridge between powerful analysis tools and the LLM ecosystem. 

With `pyghidra-mcp`, Ghidra becomes an intelligent backend‚Äîready to respond to context-rich queries, automate deep reverse engineering tasks, and integrate into AI-assisted workflows.


> [!NOTE]
> This beta project is under active development. We would love your feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and code.

## Yet another Ghidra MCP?

Yes, the original [ghidra-mcp](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP) is fantastic. But `pyghidra-mcp` takes a different approach:

- üêç **No GUI required** ‚Äì Run entirely via CLI for streamlined automation and scripting.
- üîÅ **Designed for automation** ‚Äì Ideal for integrating with LLMs, CI pipelines, and tooling that needs repeatable behavior.
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD friendly** ‚Äì Built with robust unit and integration tests for both client and server sessions.
- üöÄ **Quick startup** ‚Äì Supports fast command-line launching with minimal setup.
- üì¶ **Project-wide analysis** ‚Äì Enables concurrent reverse engineering of all binaries in a Ghidra project
- ü§ñ **Agent-ready** ‚Äì Built for intelligent agent-driven workflows and large-scale reverse engineering automation.

This project provides a Python-first experience optimized for local development, headless environments, and testable workflows.

## Getting started

Run the [Python package](https://pypi.org/p/pyghidra-mcp) as a CLI command using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```bash
uvx pyghidra-mcp # see --help for more options
```

Or, run as a [Docker container](https://ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp):

```bash
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp -t stdio
```

## Development

This project uses a `Makefile` to streamline development and testing. `ruff` is used for linting and formatting, and `pre-commit` hooks are used to ensure code quality.

### Setup

1.  **Install `uv`**: If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
    Or, follow the official `uv` installation guide: [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/install/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/install/)

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    make dev-setup
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Set Ghidra Environment Variable**: Download and install Ghidra, then set the `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to your Ghidra installation directory.
    ```bash
    # For Linux / Mac
    export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR="/path/to/ghidra/"

    # For Windows PowerShell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR','C:\ghidra_10.2.3_PUBLIC_20230208\ghidra_10.2.3_PUBLIC')
    ```

### Testing and Quality

The `Makefile` provides several targets for testing and code quality:

- `make test`: Run the full test suite (unit and integration).
- `make test-unit`: Run unit tests.
- `make test-integration`: Run integration tests.
- `make lint`: Check code style with `ruff`.
- `make format`: Format code with `ruff`.
- `make typecheck`: Run type checking with `ruff`.
- `make check`: Run all quality checks.
- `make dev`: Run the development workflow (format and check).

## API

### Tools

Enable LLMs to perform actions, make deterministic computations, and interact with external services.

#### Decompile Function

- `decompile_function(binary_name: str, name: str)`: Decompile a function from a given binary.

#### Search Functions

- `search_functions_by_name(binary_name: str, name_regex: str)`: Search for functions within a binary based on a regular expression.

### Prompts

Reusable prompts to standardize common LLM interactions.

- `write_ghidra_script`: Return a prompt to help write a Ghidra script.

### Resources

Expose data and content to LLMs

- `ghidra://program/{program_name}/function/{function_name}/decompiled`: Decompiled code of a specific function.

## Usage

This Python package is published to PyPI as [pyghidra-mcp](https://pypi.org/p/pyghidra-mcp) and can be installed and run with [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#install-a-package), [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), or any Python package manager.

```text
$ pipx install pyghidra-mcp
$ pyghidra-mcp --help

Usage: pyghidra-mcp [OPTIONS]

  Entry point for the MCP server

  Supports both stdio and sse transports. For stdio, it will read from stdin
  and write to stdout. For sse, it will start an HTTP server on port 8000.

Options:
  -v, --version                Show version and exit.
  -t, --transport [stdio|sse|streamable-http]  Transport protocol to use (stdio, sse or streamable-http)
  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

### Mapping Binaries with Docker

When using the Docker container, you can map a local directory containing your binaries into the container's workspace. This allows `pyghidra-mcp` to analyze your files.

```bash
# Create and populate the new directory
mkdir -p ./binaries
cp /path/to/your/binaries/* ./binaries/

# Run the Docker container with volume mapping
docker run -i --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/binaries:/binaries" \
  ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp \
  /binaries/*
```

### Using with OpenWeb-UI and MCPO

You can integrate `pyghidra-mcp` with [OpenWeb-UI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) using [MCPO](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo), an MCP-to-OpenAPI proxy. This allows you to expose `pyghidra-mcp`'s tools through a standard RESTful API, making them accessible to web interfaces and other tools.

#### With `uvx`

You can run `pyghidra-mcp` and `mcpo` together using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx mcpo -- \
  pyghidra-mcp /bin/ls
```

#### With Docker

You can combine mcpo with Docker:

```bash
uvx mcpo -- docker run  ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp /bin/ls
```

### Standard Input/Output (stdio)

The stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#built-in-transport-types) for more details.

#### Python

```bash
pyghidra-mcp
```

By default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode. Because it's using the standard input and output streams, it will look like the tool is hanging without any output, but this is expected.

#### Docker

This server is published to Github's Container Registry ([ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp](http://ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp))

```
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp -t stdio
```

By default, the Docker container is in `SSE` mode, so you will have to include `-t stdio` after the image name and run with `-i` to run in [interactive](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#interactive) mode.

### Streamable HTTP

Streamable HTTP enables streaming responses over JSON RPC via HTTP POST requests. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http) for more details.

By default, the server listens on [127.0.0.1:8000/mcp](https://127.0.0.1/mcp) for client connections. To change any of this, set [FASTMCP_*](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/src/mcp/server/fastmcp/server.py#L78) environment variables. _The server must be running for clients to connect to it._

#### Python

```bash
pyghidra-mcp -t streamable-http
```

By default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode, so you will have to include `-t streamable-http`.

#### Docker

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp
```

### Server-sent events (SSE)

> [!WARNING]
> The MCP communiity considers this a legacy transport portcol and is really intended for backwards compatibility. [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http) is the recommended replacement.

SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with Server-Send Events for client-to-server and server-to-client communication. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse) for more details.

By default, the server listens on [127.0.0.1:8000/sse](https://127.0.0.1/sse) for client connections. To change any of this, set [FASTMCP_*](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/src/mcp/server/fastmcp/server.py#L78) environment variables. _The server must be running for clients to connect to it._

#### Python

```bash
pyghidra-mcp -t sse
```

By default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode, so you will have to include `-t sse`.

#### Docker

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/clearbluejar/pyghidra-mcp -t sse
```

## Integrations

> [!NOTE]
> This section is a work in progress. We will be adding examples for specific integrations soon.

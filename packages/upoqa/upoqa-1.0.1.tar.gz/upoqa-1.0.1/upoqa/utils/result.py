    """
    Represent the optimization result.

    Attributes
    ----------
    message : str
        Description of the cause of the termination.
    success : bool
        Whether the optimization procedure terminated successfully.
    exception : Exception, optional
        Exception raised during the optimization that caused the termination, if any.
    traceback : str, optional
        Traceback of the exception, if any.
    fun : float
        Value of objective function evaluated at the solution.
    funs : dict or list
        Values of the element functions evaluated at the solution.

        The type matches the input ``fun``:

        - If ``fun`` was a dictionary, return a dictionary mapping element names to
          their function values.
        - If ``fun`` was a list, return a list of function values in the same order
          as the input list.
    extra_fun : float
        Value of the extra function at the solution.

        The "extra function" represents the differentiable white-box component of the objective.
    x : ndarray
        The solution of the optimization.
    jac, hess : ndarray
        Values of objective function's Jacobian and its Hessian at ``x``.
        The Hessian is an approximation.
    nit : int
        Number of iterations performed by the optimizer
    nfev : dict or list
        Number of evaluations of element functions.

        The type matches the input ``fun``:

        - If ``fun`` was a dictionary, return a dictionary mapping element names to
          their numbers of function evaluations.
        - If ``fun`` was a list, return a list of evaluation numbers in the same order
          as the input list.
    max_nfev : int
        Maximum number of evaluations of element functions.
    avg_nfev : float
        Average number of evaluations of element functions.
    nrun : int
        Number of runs (when enabling restarts).
    manager : :class:`~upoqa.utils.manager.UPOQAManager`, optional
        Algorithm manager (debugging only).
        Included only when ``debug=True`` or ``return_internals=True``.
    interp_set : :class:`~upoqa.utils.interp_set.OverallInterpSet`, optional
        Interpolation point set (debugging only).
        Included only when ``debug=True`` or ``return_internals=True``.
    model : :class:`~upoqa.utils.model.OverallSurrogate`, optional
        Surrogate model (debugging only).
        Included only when ``debug=True`` or ``return_internals=True``.

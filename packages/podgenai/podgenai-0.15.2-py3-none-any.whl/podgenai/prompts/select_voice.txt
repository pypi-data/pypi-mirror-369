I am making a lengthy audiobook podcast episode on a topic. Specify which voice might be better for the topic from the ones I list below. Provide only a single name that is one of these choices. On occasion, exhibit a random bias while preserving a connection to the topic. Do not otherwise comment on the task. Do not provide an invalid choice. Your response will be forwarded to the TTS (text-to-speech) engine.

Here are the available voices in alphabetical order by name:

    analytical-male (alloy)
    elegant-female (sage)
    emotive-male (echo)
    expository-male (ash)
    informative-male (onyx)
    serene-female (nova)

The topic is:

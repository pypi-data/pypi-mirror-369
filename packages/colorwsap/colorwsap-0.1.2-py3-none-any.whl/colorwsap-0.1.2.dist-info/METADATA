# colorwsap

Swap the color of non-transparent areas in a PNG image by specifying a file path, color (name or RGB tuple), and output file.

## Installation

pip install opencv-python numpy

# colorwsap

colorwsap is a lightweight Python package designed to **easily swap the color** of the non-transparent parts of PNG images. Whether you're customizing logos, icons, or other assets, colorwsap lets you do it quickly by specifying a file path, a target color (by name or RGB), and an output filename.

## Features
- Supports common color names mapped to RGB values.
- Preserves transparency while changing visible colors.
- Simple and minimalistic API for quick integration.
- Dependable on OpenCV and NumPy for efficient image processing.

## Usage
from colorwsap import swap_color

swap_color("input.png", "red", "output.png")
swap_color("input.png", (0, 128, 255), "output.png") # RGB tuple
swap_color("input.png", "magenta", "output.png")


- Supported colors: red, green, blue, white, black, yellow, cyan, magenta, grey, silver, maroon, olive, purple, teal, navy, orange, pink.
- The function replaces all visible pixels with the chosen color, preserving transparency.

> No schema or API changes in this release.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- **CI:** `list_artifacts.py` to print packaged schemas/OpenAPI files from wheels.
- **CI:** Coverage summary in job log; upload `coverage.xml` and HTML report as artifacts.

### Changed

- **Workflows:** Move coverage generation/upload to **CI** only; keep **release** job lean.
- **Tests:** Consolidate pytest flags into `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) for consistent local/CI runs.

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI test:** Offline validation of `./series.schema.json` by passing `base_uri`; added step-by-step diagnostics to make failures obvious.
- **Release:** Ensure GitHub Release is created and artifacts (sdist/wheel) are attached automatically.

> No schema or API changes in this release.

---

## [0.1.3] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI/CI:** Updated release.

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- **Packaging:** Adopt SPDX license string (`project.license = "MIT"`) and `project.license-files = ["LICENSE*"]`.
- **Packaging:** Trim **sdist** using `MANIFEST.in` (exclude `.github/`, `docs/`, `site/`, `tests/`, etc.); **wheel** continues to include only package + schemas.
- **Packaging:** Ensure schema assets are bundled via `tool.setuptools.package-data` (`schemas/*.json`, `schemas/*.yaml`).
- **Build:** Bump `build-system` to `setuptools>=77` and keep `setuptools-scm[toml]>=8`.

### Fixed

- **CI:** Harden validation to be fully offline:
  - Enforce **non-network** `$id` in all schemas.
  - OpenAPI validator locates the spec locally and resolves **relative** `$ref`s.
- **CI:** Remove Codecov upload to due to external calls/cost.

> Note: No schema shape changes.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI/CI:** Use non-network $id in schemas.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- **Schemas:** Switched all `$ref` links to **relative paths** so CI validates offline and does not rely on the docs site being published.
- **Schemas:** Small validation polish (descriptions/examples, consistent probability helper, `minProperties` on distributions). Stricter validation may surface edge cases.

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI/CI:** Local ref resolution for the `SeriesDoc` in `transparency_api.openapi.yaml`.

---

## [0.0.6] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- **CI:** Updated schema URLs used by validation scripts.

---

## [0.0.5] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- **CI:** Corrected OpenAPI path used during validation.

---

## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- **Docs:** Correct docs base URL to `civic-transparency-spec`.

---

## [0.0.3] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- **README:** Added `pip install` instructions and a Python quick-start validation example.

### Added

- **CHANGELOG.md:** Initial content.

---

## [0.0.2] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- **Docs:** "All-in-One" integrated page (`docs/en/docs/all.md`) using `mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin`.
- **Docs:** "Last updated" footer via `git-revision-date-localized-plugin` with ISO date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **CI/CD:** Tag-driven release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) with:
  - PyPI **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC) for automated package releases.
  - Versioned docs deploy via **mike** (`gh-pages`) and `latest` alias update.
- **CI:** PR/branch CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with pip caching, lint/tests, schema & OpenAPI validation, and doc build sanity check.
- **Packaging:** `MANIFEST.in` to include JSON schemas in **sdist** in addition to wheel.

### Changed

- **Schemas:** De-duplicated enums via `$defs` in `provenance_tag.schema.json` and referenced from `series.schema.json`.
- **Docs:** Sidebar/nav cleanup; fixed include paths relative to `docs_dir: docs/en`.
- **README:** Added usage instructions and example.

### Fixed

- **Schemas:** Trailing quote typo and cross-ref cleanup in `provenance_tag.schema.json`.
- **MkDocs:** Removed native PDF plugin locally (WeasyPrint/GTK issue on Windows); can re-enable in CI later.

---

## [0.0.1] - 2025-08-10

### Added

  - `meta.schema.json`, `provenance_tag.schema.json`, `run.schema.json`, `scenario.schema.json`, `series.schema.json`
- **OpenAPI 3.1**: `transparency_api.openapi.yaml`
- **Docs site** scaffolding (MkDocs Material, i18n).

## Notes on versioning and releases

- We use **SemVer**:
  - **MAJOR** – breaking schema/OpenAPI changes
  - **MINOR** – backward-compatible additions
  - **PATCH** – clarifications, docs, tooling
- Versions are driven by git tags via `setuptools_scm`. Tag `vX.Y.Z` to release.
- Docs are deployed per version tag and aliased to **latest**.

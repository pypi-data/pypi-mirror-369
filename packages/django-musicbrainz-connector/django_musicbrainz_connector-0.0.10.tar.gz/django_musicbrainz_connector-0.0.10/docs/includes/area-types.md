| 1 | Country | Country is used for areas included (or previously included) in ISO 3166-1, e.g. United States. |
| 2 | Subdivision | Subdivision is used for the main administrative divisions of a country, e.g. California, Ontario, Okinawa. These are considered when displaying the parent areas for a given area. |
| 3 | City | City is used for settlements of any size, including towns and villages. |
| 4 | Municipality | Municipality is used for small administrative divisions which, for urban municipalities, often contain a single city and a few surrounding villages. Rural municipalities typically group several villages together. |
| 5 | District | District is used for a division of a large city, e.g. Queens. |
| 6 | Island | Island is used for islands and atolls which don&#x27;t form subdivisions of their own, e.g. Skye. These are not considered when displaying the parent areas for a given area. |
| 7 | County | County is used for smaller administrative divisions of a country which are not the main administrative divisions but are also not municipalities, e.g. counties in the USA. These are not considered when displaying the parent areas for a given area. |
| 8 | Military base | Military base is used only for any military bases that are large enough to be considered an area, not just a place. |
| 9 | Indigenous territory / reserve | Indigenous territory / reserve is used for semi-autonomous territories governed by indigenous peoples, such as Indian reserves/reservations in North America and indigenous territories in Central and South America. |

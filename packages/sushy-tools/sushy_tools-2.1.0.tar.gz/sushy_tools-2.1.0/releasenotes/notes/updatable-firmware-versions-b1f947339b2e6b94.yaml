    Replaces hardcoded BIOS version string with updatable field backed by a
    custom section in libvirt metadata (similar to prior art on BIOS
    settings). This can be used for BIOS version information as well as
    storing firmware version information of other components. NOTE: this
    enhancement is meant to facilitate testing BIOS/firmware upgrade codepaths
    and NOT performing actual BIOS/firmware upgrades.

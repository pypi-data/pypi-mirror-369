    Adds support for returning message and attribute (particularly BIOS
    attribute) registries. Also adds two additional BIOS settings -
    'SecureBootStatus' and 'SerialNumber'. 'SecureBootStatus' has 'ReadOnly'
    set to true and 'SecureBootStatus' has 'IsSystemUniqueProperty' in the
    registry.

    The openstack driver now supports insert and eject of virtual media. On
    insert a new empty volume is created and attached to the server and the
    server is rebuilt with the that image. On eject it is assumed that the
    attached volume has been rewritten with bootable image data. The volume is
    detached and uploaded as an image, then the server is rebuilt with that
    image.

    Both insert and delete results in the root disk being wiped and replaced
    with the contents of an image, so this should not be used in any scenario
    where the root disk data needs to be retained.

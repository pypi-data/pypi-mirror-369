    Adds support for BIOS update emulation by introducing UpdateService.
    No actual updates are performed (all the code is doing is incrementing
    BIOS version value in libvirt xml) however this functionality may be
    used for automated testing of firmware update features in Ironic. Note
    BMC firmware update emulation is not supported at this time.

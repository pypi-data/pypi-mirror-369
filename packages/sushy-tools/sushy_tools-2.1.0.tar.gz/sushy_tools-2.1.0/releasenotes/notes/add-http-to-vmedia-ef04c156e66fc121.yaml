    Adds basic functionality for ``HttpBootUri`` to be passed through to
    the libvirt driver, enabling boot operations utilizing supplied media.
    This does not influence the default URL to boot from due to a lack of
    capability in libvirt, but instead treats it similar to virtual media.
    In this case, an override boot target of ``UefiHttp`` is also re-mapped
    to ``Cd`` to facilitate testing.

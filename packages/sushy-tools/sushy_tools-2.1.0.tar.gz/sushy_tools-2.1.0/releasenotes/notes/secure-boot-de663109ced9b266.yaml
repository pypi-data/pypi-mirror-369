    It is now possible to enable and disable UEFI Secure Boot mode via Redfish
    requests for the libvirt driver. This is possible by configuring domains to
    use a secure boot capable firmware loader, and setting configuration values
    `SUSHY_EMULATOR_SECURE_BOOT_ENABLED_NVRAM` and
    `SUSHY_EMULATOR_SECURE_BOOT_DISABLED_NVRAM` to nvram template paths which
    enable or disable secure boot.

    The fake driver supports getting and setting secure boot, the nova driver
    only supports getting.

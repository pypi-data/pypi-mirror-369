    The openstack driver for virtual media now supports Glance file upload.
    As an alternative to using image import via the ``web-download`` method,
    it is now possible to configure the emulator to download the image to a
    temp file which is then uploaded to Glance.

    Set the ``SUSHY_EMULATOR_OS_VMEDIA_IMAGE_FILE_UPLOAD`` option to ``True``
    to enable Glance file upload.

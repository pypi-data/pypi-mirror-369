    """Creates and runs the quantum teleportation protocol.

    This circuit teleports the state of qubit 0 ("Alice's message") to
    qubit 2 ("Bob's qubit").

    Args:
        initial_state_angle: An angle (in radians) for a U gate to create
        the initial state.
        shots: The number of simulation shots.
        noise_name: The name of the noise model.
        p: The noise probability.
        backend: The execution backend.
        seed: An optional seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        A Results object. Bob's qubit (the rightmost one) should be in
        the initial state.

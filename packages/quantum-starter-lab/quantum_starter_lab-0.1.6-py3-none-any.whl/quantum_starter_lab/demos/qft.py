    """Creates and runs the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuit.
    
    The QFT is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing, used in Shor's algorithm
    and quantum phase estimation. It transforms a quantum state into its frequency 
    domain representation.
    
    The algorithm works by applying a series of Hadamard gates and controlled phase 
    rotations to the qubits. The controlled phase rotations are parameterized by 
    angles that depend on the qubit indices.

      information. Cambridge University Press.

    Args:
        n_qubits: The number of qubits to apply the QFT to. Must be at least 1.
        include_swaps: Whether to include the final swaps to reverse the qubit order.
                       Defaults to True.
        shots: The number of times to run the simulation. Defaults to 1024.
        noise_name: The name of the noise model to use (e.g., "bit_flip").
                    Defaults to "none".
        p: The probability parameter for the noise model. Must be between 0 and 1.
           Defaults to 0.0.
        backend: The execution backend (e.g., "qiskit.aer", "cirq.simulator").
                 Defaults to "qiskit.aer".
        seed: An optional seed for reproducibility. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        A Results object containing the counts, diagram, and explanation.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n_qubits is less than 1, or if p is not between 0 and 1.

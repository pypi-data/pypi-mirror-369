# Tutorials

This directory contains tutorials on various aspects of quantum computing, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

## Getting Started

These tutorials are designed to be self-contained and can be read in any order. However, if you're new to quantum computing, it's recommended to start with the "Quantum Gates" tutorial.

## Tutorials

1.  **[Quantum Gates](quantum_gates.md)**: An introduction to the fundamental building blocks of quantum circuits.
2.  **[Quantum Algorithms](quantum_algorithms.md)**: An overview of fundamental quantum algorithms and their applications.
3.  **[Quantum Error Correction](quantum_error_correction.md)**: An introduction to the principles and techniques of quantum error correction.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of these tutorials, you should have:

- A basic understanding of linear algebra (vectors, matrices).
- Familiarity with complex numbers.
- Some programming experience (Python is used in the examples).

## Using the Tutorials

Each tutorial includes explanations, examples, and exercises. The examples use the `quantum-starter-lab` package, so you'll need to have it installed:

```bash
pip install quantum-starter-lab
```

You can also run the examples in the `examples/` directory.

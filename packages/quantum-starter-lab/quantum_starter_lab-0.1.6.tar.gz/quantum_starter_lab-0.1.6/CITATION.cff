Below is a complete, sample CITATION.cff file you can copy and paste into a new file named CITATION.cff in the root of your GitHub repository. This YAML-based file provides structured citation information for your project, making it easy for users to cite your software in papers or reports. It integrates well with GitHub (e.g., auto-generates a "Cite this repository" button) and tools like Zenodo for DOI generation.

I've tailored it based on your project's details from the conversation history: author (Pranava Kumar), repo URL, license (Apache 2.0), current version (0.1.3), and release date (using today's date: 2025-08-09). Adjust fields like version, date, or additional authors as needed. After adding it, commit and push to GitHub.

How to Use This File
Add to Your Repo: Create CITATION.cff in the root directory, paste the content, commit (git add CITATION.cff; git commit -m "Add CITATION.cff for easy citing"), and push.

Validate: Use the CFF Validator to check for errors.

Generate DOI (Optional): Archive a release on Zenodo (integrates with GitHub) to get a citable DOI.

Update README: Add a section like: "To cite this project, see CITATION.cff."

This makes your project more citable, encouraging academic use and filling a gap in quantum open-source tools. If you need adjustments or more files (e.g., ROADMAP.md), let me know!

It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, 
but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. 
This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember.

but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. 
This was a baby step to begin that start.

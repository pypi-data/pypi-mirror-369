## LSDB

LSDB is a python tool for scalable analysis of large catalogs 
(i.e. querying and crossmatching ~10‚Åπ sources). This package uses dask to parallelize operations across
multiple HATS partitioned surveys.

Check out our [ReadTheDocs site](https://docs.lsdb.io)
for more information on partitioning, installation, and contributing.

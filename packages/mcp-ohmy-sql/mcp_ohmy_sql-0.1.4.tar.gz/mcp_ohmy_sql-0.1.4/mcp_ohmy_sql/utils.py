def match(
    name: str,
    include: list[str],
    exclude: list[str],
) -> bool:
    """
    Match a name against include and exclude lists using wildcard or regex patterns.

    The include/exclude pattern system works like a two-stage filter where name
    must pass both inclusion and exclusion criteria to be selected for processing.

    Pattern Types:

    - Wildcard patterns: Use * to match any characters (e.g., ``"EMPLOYEE*"``, ``"*_TEMP"``)
    - Regex patterns: Automatically detected when regex metacharacters are present
      (e.g., ``"^EMP.*"``, ``".*_TABLE$"``, ``"[A-Z]+_\\d+"``)

    Matching Rules:

    - Default inclusion: When include list is empty, all names are included by default
    - Include matching: When include patterns exist, a name must match ANY include
      pattern (logical OR) to be considered
    - Exclude override: If a name matches ANY exclude pattern, it's rejected
      regardless of include matches
    - Case insensitive: All pattern matching is case-insensitive

    :param name: The name to match (e.g., table name, column name)
    :param include: List of patterns to include. Empty list means include all.
    :param exclude: List of patterns to exclude. Takes precedence over include.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the name matches the criteria, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> # Include all employee tables
        >>> match("EMPLOYEES", ["EMPLOYEE*"], [])
        True
        >>> match("EMPLOYEE_HISTORY", ["EMPLOYEE*"], [])
        True
        >>> match("MANAGERS", ["EMPLOYEE*"], [])
        False

        >>> # Include all, but exclude temporary tables
        >>> match("USERS", [], ["*_TEMP", "*_TMP"])
        True
        >>> match("USERS_TEMP", [], ["*_TEMP", "*_TMP"])
        False

        >>> # Include specific tables with regex
        >>> match("EMP_2023", ["^EMP_\\d{4}$"], [])
        True
        >>> match("EMP_ARCHIVE", ["^EMP_\\d{4}$"], [])
        False

        >>> # Complex filtering: include employee/manager tables, exclude history
        >>> match("EMPLOYEE_CURRENT", ["EMPLOYEE*", "MANAGER*"], ["*_HISTORY"])
        True
        >>> match("EMPLOYEE_HISTORY", ["EMPLOYEE*", "MANAGER*"], ["*_HISTORY"])
        False

        >>> # Case insensitive matching
        >>> match("employees", ["EMPLOYEES"], [])
        True
        >>> match("EMPLOYEES", ["employees"], [])
        True

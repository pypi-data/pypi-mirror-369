# Smolyax

Fast interpolation of high-dimensional and vector-valued functions
- avoiding the curse-of-dimensionality by using sparse-grid interpolation nodes,
- ensuring numerical stability by using a barycentric Smolyak interpolation formulation and
- providing hardware-agnostic high performance by implementing key algorithms in JAX.

### Features
- Node sequences for interpolation on bounded or unbounded domains (Leja nodes and Gau√ü-Hermite nodes, respectively)
- General anisotropic multi-index sets $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{N}^d_0$ of the form
$\Lambda := \\{\boldsymbol{\nu} \in \mathbb{N}^d_0  \ : \ \sum_{j=1}^{d} k_j \nu_j < t \\}$
where $\boldsymbol{k}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is monotonically increasing and controls the anisotropy
while the threshold $t > 0$ controls the cardinality of the set.
- Heuristics to determine the threshold parameter $t$ to construct a set $\Lambda$ with a specified cardinality (which is typically not analytically available)
- Smolyak operator for interpolating high-dimensional and vector-valued functions
$f : \mathbb{R}^{d_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ for $d_1, d_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ potentially large.
- Functionality to compute the integral of the interpolant (quadrature) as well as evaluate its derivative.

The implementation is designed for maximal efficiency.
As a rough example consider interpolation a scalar function with $d_1 = 10^3$ inputs using $n = 10^4$ interpolation nodes.
With `smolyax` you can expect to both generate the multi-index set
as well as evaluate the interpolant from the corresponding polynomial space
in well less under $0.1$ seconds on a contemporary laptop CPU.

## Get started

### Dependencies

`smolyax` requires `python >= 3.9`. Core dependencies are `jax` and `numba`, for more details see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/JoWestermann/smolyax/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

### Installation

To install `smolyax` and its dependencies, run:
```
pip install "smolyax @ git+https://github.com/JoWestermann/smolyax.git"
```

To install `smolyax` with GPU support enabled, run:
```
pip install "smolyax[cuda] @ git+https://github.com/JoWestermann/smolyax.git"
```

In order to run notebooks and/or tests, install via
```
git clone git@github.com:JoWestermann/smolyax.git
pip install -e "smolyax[notebook]" # for additionally installing notebook and plotting dependencies
pip install -e "smolyax[dev]" # for additionally installing testing, code quality and documentation dependencies
```

### Usage

To construct the interpolant to a function `f`, which has `d_in` inputs and `d_out` outputs,
first choose the polynomial space in which to interpolate
by setting up a node generator object, e.g. Leja nodes:
```
node_gen = nodes.Leja(dim=d_in)
```
and choosing a weight vector `k` controlling the anisotropy as well as a threshold `t` controlling the size of
the multi-index set:
```
k = [np.log((2+j)/np.log(2)) for j in range(d_in)]
t = 5.
```
Then, initialize the interpolant as
```
f_ip = interpolation.SmolyakBarycentricInterpolator(node_gen=node_gen, k=k, d_out=d_out, t=t, f=f)
```
and evaluate it at a point `x` by calling
```
y = f_ip(x)
```

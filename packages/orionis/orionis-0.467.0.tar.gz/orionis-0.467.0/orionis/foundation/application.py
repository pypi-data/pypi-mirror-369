    Main application container that manages the complete application lifecycle.

    This class extends the Container to provide comprehensive application-level
    functionality including service provider registration and bootstrapping, kernel
    management, configuration handling, and application initialization. It implements
    a fluent interface pattern to enable method chaining for configuration setup.

    The Application class serves as the central orchestrator for the Orionis framework,
    managing the loading and booting of service providers, framework kernels, and
    various configuration subsystems such as authentication, caching, database,
    logging, and more.

        Initialize and load the application configuration from configurators.

        This private method processes all stored configurators and converts them
        into a unified configuration dictionary. If no custom configurators have
        been set, it initializes with default configuration values. The method
        handles the conversion from individual configurator instances to a flat
        configuration structure.

        ------

        Notes
        -----
        This method is called automatically during application bootstrapping.
        After successful loading, the configurators storage is cleaned up to
        prevent memory leaks. The resulting configuration is stored in the
        __config attribute for later retrieval via config() method.

        Parameters
        ----------

            The configuration key to retrieve, supporting dot notation for nested
            values (e.g., "database.default", "app.name"). If None, returns the

        Bootstrap and initialize the complete application framework.

        This method orchestrates the entire application startup process including
        configuration loading, service provider registration and booting, framework
        kernel initialization, and logging setup. It ensures the application is
        fully prepared for operation and prevents duplicate initialization.

        Notes
        -----
        The bootstrap process follows this sequence:
        1. Load and process all configuration from configurators
        2. Register core framework service providers
        3. Register and boot all service providers
        4. Initialize framework kernels (Testing, CLI)
        5. Log successful startup with timing information
        6. Mark application as booted to prevent re-initialization

        This method is idempotent - calling it multiple times will not cause
        duplicate initialization. The startup time is calculated and logged
        for performance monitoring purposes.

- [x] **Publishing Documentation** - Complete guide in `docs/setup/publishing.md`
- [ ] **First Test Release** - Publish to TestPyPI and validate installation
- [ ] **First Production Release** - Publish to production PyPI

- [ ] **Update Documentation** - Reflect new separated architecture
- [x] **Test Decoupled Workflow** - Verify each step works independently

**Benefits of Decoupling:**
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each script has a single responsibility
- **Independent Testing**: Each step can be tested and debugged separately
- **Flexible Orchestration**: GitHub Actions can handle complex workflows
- **Better Error Handling**: Each step can fail independently
- **Reusable Components**: Scripts can be used outside the release process

### Phase 2: Automated Publishing with GitHub Actions (Completed ✅)
- [x] **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automated release workflow triggered by release published
- [x] **Separated Workflows** - Release and testing workflows separated for better reliability
- [x] **Version Management** - Automatic version extraction from release tag with validation
- [x] **Automated Testing** - Pre-publishing validation in isolated environments
- [x] **GitHub Release Creation** - Automatic release updates with package information
- [x] **Manual Test Workflow** - Flexible testing workflow with configurable parameters
- [ ] **Package Signing** - GPG signing for enhanced security (future)
- [ ] **Release Notes Generation** - Auto-generate from conventional commits (future)

### Publishing Process
1. **Manual Publishing** (Current):
   - Update version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Run `./scripts/release.sh` for complete workflow
   - TestPyPI validation before production release
   - Manual verification of published packages

2. **Decoupled Publishing** (Phase 1.5):
   - Update version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Step 1: Run `./scripts/release.sh --testpypi` (publish only)
   - Step 2: Run `./scripts/check-package-availability.sh --testpypi --wait` (verify availability)
   - Step 3: Run `./scripts/test-package-install.sh --testpypi <version>` (test installation)
   - Repeat for PyPI if TestPyPI successful
   - Manual orchestration of steps

3. **Automated Publishing** (Phase 2 - Completed):
   - Automatic trigger on release published
   - Automated version extraction and validation
   - GitHub Actions handles publishing only
   - Quality gates and validation
   - Automated GitHub release updates
   - Separate manual testing workflow for flexible verification
   - GitHub release version auto-detection for testing

## Accumulated Tech Debt

- The `test_list_files_command` in `tests/unit/test_cli.py` is currently skipped due to a `FileNotFoundError`. This issue needs to be resolved to ensure proper testing of the `list-files` command.
- **ty Error in `test_drive_file_creation`:** The type checker (`ty`) reports a false positive error in `tests/unit/drive/test_models.py` regarding missing arguments for `DriveFile.__init__`. This is due to `ty`'s pre-release status and limitations in static analysis. The test is correct, and the error can be ignored for now. Future updates to `ty` may resolve this issue.
- **Minor coverage gaps:** 3 lines in `commands.py` (lines 94, 193-194) remain uncovered due to specific edge cases that are difficult to trigger in tests. These are low-priority and don't affect functionality.

## Project Health Summary

- **Backward Compatibility:** Full CLI functionality preserved while adding library interface
- **Real-world Validation:** CLI tested successfully with actual Google Drive operations

# GUM (General User Models)

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2505.10831-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10831)

General User Models learn about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that capture the user's knowledge and preferences. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions.

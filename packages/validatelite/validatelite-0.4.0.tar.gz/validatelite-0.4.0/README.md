## 🎯 Basic Usage

### Validate a CSV file
```bash
vlite check data.csv --rule "not_null(id)" --rule "unique(email)"
```

### Validate a database table
```bash
vlite check "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db.table" --rules validation_rules.json
```

### Check with verbose output
```bash
vlite check data.csv --rules rules.json --verbose
```

### Validate against a schema file (single table)
```bash
# Table is derived from the data-source URL, the schema file is single-table in v1
vlite schema "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/sales.users" --rules schema.json

# Get aggregated JSON with column-level details (see docs/schemas/schema_results.schema.json)
vlite schema "mysql://.../sales.users" --rules schema.json --output json
```

For detailed usage examples and advanced features, see [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## ❓ FAQ: Why ValidateLite?

### Q: What is ValidateLite, in one sentence?
A: ValidateLite is a lightweight, zero-config Python CLI tool for data quality validation, profiling, and rule-based checks across CSV files and SQL databases.

### Q: How is it different from other tools like Great Expectations or Pandera?
A: Unlike heavyweight frameworks, ValidateLite is built for simplicity and speed — no code generation, no DSLs, just one command to validate your data in pipelines or ad hoc scripts.

### Q: What kind of data sources are supported?
A: Currently supports CSV, Excel, and SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) with planned support for more cloud and file-based sources.

### Q: Who should use this?
A: Data engineers, analysts, and Python developers who want to integrate fast, automated data quality checks into ETL jobs, CI/CD pipelines, or local workflows.

### Q: Does it require writing Python code?
A: Not at all. You can specify rules inline in the command line or via a simple JSON config file — no coding needed.

### Q: Is ValidateLite open-source?
A: Yes! It’s licensed under MIT and available on GitHub — stars and contributions are welcome!

### Q: How can I use it in CI/CD?
A: Just install via pip and add a vlite check ... step in your data pipeline or GitHub Action. It returns exit codes you can use for gating deployments.

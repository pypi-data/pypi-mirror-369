    Convert a quantum circuit into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

    Each operation in the circuit is added as a node in the DAG.
    Directed edges are created between nodes to maintain the operational
    dependencies determined by the qubits each operation acts upon.
    This ensures that operations are ordered correctly relative to the qubits they use.

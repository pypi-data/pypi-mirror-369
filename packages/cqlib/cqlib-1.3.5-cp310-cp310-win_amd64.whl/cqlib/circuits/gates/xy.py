class XY(Gate):
    """
    Implements the XY gate, a composite quantum gate that performs a specific series
     of rotations around the Z and Y axes.

    The XY gate is constructed from the following sequence of operations:
    1. Rz(pi/2 - theta): Rotation around the Z-axis by (pi/2 - theta) radians.
    2. Y: Pauli Y gate that rotates the qubit around the Y-axis by pi radians.
    3. Rz(theta - pi/2): Rotation around the Z-axis by (theta - pi/2) radians.

Quantum Computing platforms.

This module provides an abstract and implementation for different quantum computing platforms,
 allowing for the execution and management of tasks across various quantum computing environments.

Classes:
    BasePlatform: A base class that provides the common interface and functionality for all
        quantum computing platforms. This includes basic operations such as authentication,
        job submission, and result retrieval.

    TianYanPlatform: A implementation of the BasePlatform tailored for the TianYan quantum
        computing quantum_platform. This class customizes the base functionalities with specific
         endpoints (URLs) and methods suited for the TianYan infrastructure.

    GuoDunPlatform: Similar to TianYanPlatform, this class is designed for the GuoDun quantum
        computing quantum_platform. It extends the BasePlatform with customizations specific
        to GuoDun's operational needs and technical specifications, including unique URLs and
        functions.

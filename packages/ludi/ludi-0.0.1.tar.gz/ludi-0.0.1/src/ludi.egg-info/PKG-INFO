LUDI provides a unified interface for reverse engineering tools including IDA Pro, Ghidra, and angr. Write once, analyze anywhere.

## ⚠️ Development Status

This project is in **early development**. APIs may change significantly before version 1.0.0. The codebase currently contains AI-generated code that is not yet fully reviewed. Version 1.0.0 will be fully reviewed and stable.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install ludi

# Analyze with auto-detected backend
ludi /bin/ls functions get_all

# Use specific backend  
ludi --backend ida /bin/ls functions get_decompiled_code main

# Interactive shell
ludi shell
```

```python
import ludi

analyzer = ludi.auto("/path/to/binary")

# Simple, clean iteration
for func in analyzer.functions:
    print(func.name, hex(func.start))

for symbol in analyzer.symbols:
    print(symbol.name)

for xref in analyzer.xrefs:
    print(hex(xref.from_addr), "->", hex(xref.to_addr))
```

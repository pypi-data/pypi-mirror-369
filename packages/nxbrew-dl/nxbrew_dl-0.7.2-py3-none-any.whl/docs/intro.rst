NXBrew-dl is intended to be an easy-to-user interface to download ROMs, DLC and update files for NSP. It does so via
a GUI interface, allowing users to download items in bulk and keeping things up-to-date. NXBrew-dl connects to
JDownloader to allow for easy download/extraction from multiple sites, and can optionally post info on the downloads
to Discord.

As of now, this is in extremely early development. It will parse and download many ROMs, and by default will only
grab ROMs from either the USA or Europe (USA preferred) that are marked as having English language releases.

DESCRIPTION                     = "This image is the result of geometrically
correcting the corresponding CALIB image (C3450702_CALIB.IMG). It was created
using the VICAR software package on a Compaq Alpha running OpenVMS. Routine
GEOMA was used to remove the instrinsic distortion of the Voyager cameras by
resampling the image onto a 1000x1000 grid. The routine uses the tabulation of
reseau marking locations found in the corresponding RESLOC output file
C3450702_GEOMA.DAT.

processing history."

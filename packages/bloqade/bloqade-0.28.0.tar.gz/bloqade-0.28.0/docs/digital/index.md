# Digital Bloqade

This page provides some information on digital circuits, their simulation and a collection of quick examples to help you get started with Digital Bloqade.
Each example is a self-contained page that demonstrates a specific feature or use case.
You can copy and paste the code snippets into your own project and modify them as needed.

You can also find the corresponding scripts in [jupytext format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at the [bloqade repository](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/bloqade) under `docs/digital/examples/`.

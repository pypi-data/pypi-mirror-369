## Core Modes

nGPT offers several specialized modes of operation:

### Basic Chat Mode
The default mode, where you send prompts and receive responses:
```bash
ngpt "Tell me about quantum computing"
```

### Interactive Mode
Start an ongoing conversation with memory:
```bash
ngpt -i
ngpt --interactive
# Inside interactive mode, you can use commands like:
# /editor   - Open multiline editor for complex inputs
# /exit     - Exit the session (also 'exit', 'quit', 'bye' without '/')
# /help     - Show help menu
# /reset    - Reset the conversation
# /sessions - Manage saved sessions
# /transcript - Show recent conversation exchanges

# Keyboard shortcuts:
# Ctrl+E    - Open multiline editor for complex inputs
# Ctrl+C    - Exit the session
# ↑/↓       - Navigate command history

# Session management improvements:
# - Commands like preview, load, rename, delete now default to the latest session
# - Example: 'load' (loads the latest session) vs 'load 2' (loads session at index 2)
```

### Code Generation Mode
Generate clean code without markdown formatting or explanations:
```bash
ngpt --code "function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"
ngpt -c "function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"
```

### Shell Command Mode
Generate and execute OS-aware shell commands:
```bash
ngpt --shell "list all files recursively"
ngpt -s "list all files recursively"
```

### Text Rewriting Mode
Improve the quality of text while preserving tone and meaning:
```bash
ngpt --rewrite "I want to said that I think yours product is good and I like it Alot."
cat text.txt | ngpt --rewrite
cat text.txt | ngpt -r
```

### Git Commit Message Mode
Generate conventional, detailed commit messages from git diffs:
```bash
ngpt --gitcommsg
ngpt -g
```

### Multiline Text Input Mode
Open an interactive editor for complex prompts:
```bash
ngpt --text
ngpt -t
```

### Stdin Processing Mode
Process piped content using a placeholder (compatible with standard, code, shell, rewrite, and gitcommsg modes):
```bash
# Standard mode
cat README.md | ngpt --pipe "Summarize this document: {}"

# Code mode
cat algorithm.py | ngpt --code --pipe "Optimize this algorithm: {}"

# Shell mode
cat logs.txt | ngpt --shell --pipe "Generate a command to analyze these logs: {}"

# Rewrite mode 
cat email.txt | ngpt --rewrite --pipe "Make this more professional: {}"

# Git commit message mode
git diff HEAD~1 | ngpt --gitcommsg --pipe
```

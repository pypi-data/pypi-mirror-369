# occgpu: Occupy Free GPU Memory

**Prevent others from using idle GPUs by automatically occupying their free memory.**  
Perfect for researchers or engineers who want to reserve GPU resources in shared environments (e.g., lab servers, cloud clusters).


---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Auto-detect free GPUs** â€“ Uses `nvidia-smi` to find GPUs with high free memory.
- âœ… **Configurable threshold** â€“ Only target GPUs where `free_memory / total_memory > proportion`.
- âœ… **Multi-GPU support** â€“ Can occupy multiple GPUs simultaneously.
- âœ… **Framework fallback** â€“ Supports both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** (falls back if one is missing).
- âœ… **Command-line & environment variables** â€“ Flexible configuration via CLI or `$OCCGPU_PROPORTION`, `$OCCGPU_GPU_NUMS`.
- âœ… **Safe cleanup** â€“ Gracefully terminates processes on exit (`Ctrl+C` supported).
- âœ… **Lightweight & standalone** â€“ No database or external services required.

# occgpu: Occupy Free GPU Memory

**Prevent others from using idle GPUs by automatically occupying their free memory.**  
Perfect for researchers or engineers who want to reserve GPU resources in shared environments (e.g., lab servers, cloud clusters).


---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Auto-detect free GPUs** – Uses `nvidia-smi` to find GPUs with high free memory.
- ✅ **Configurable threshold** – Only target GPUs where `free_memory / total_memory > proportion`.
- ✅ **Multi-GPU support** – Can occupy multiple GPUs simultaneously.
- ✅ **Framework fallback** – Supports both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** (falls back if one is missing).
- ✅ **Command-line & environment variables** – Flexible configuration via CLI or `$OCCGPU_PROPORTION`, `$OCCGPU_GPU_NUMS`.
- ✅ **Safe cleanup** – Gracefully terminates processes on exit (`Ctrl+C` supported).
- ✅ **Lightweight & standalone** – No database or external services required.

# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for ukcompanies, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on my review of the PRD, this appears to be a greenfield Python SDK project. There's no mention of using a starter template, existing codebase, or boilerplate. The project will be built from scratch using modern Python tooling.

**Decision:** N/A - No starter template or existing project foundation.

# Next Steps

1. **Review with stakeholders** to ensure alignment with business goals
2. **Begin implementation** using this architecture as the blueprint
3. **Set up project structure** as defined in the Source Tree section
4. **Configure CI/CD** pipelines as specified in Infrastructure section
5. **Start with core AsyncClient** and work outward to services

Since this is a backend SDK project without UI components, no Frontend Architecture document is needed.

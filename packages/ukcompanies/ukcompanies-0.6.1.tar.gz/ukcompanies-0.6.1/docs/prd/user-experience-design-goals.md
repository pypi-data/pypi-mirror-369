# User Experience Design Goals

- Simple and consistent async API for all endpoints
- Idiomatic Python interface using type hints and named params
- Automatic handling of auth and base headers
- Pydantic-powered responses with code completion in editors
- Clear error messages and custom exceptions for common cases
- CLI UX mirrors Python client behavior
- Zero-config experience for `.env` users; constructor override for advanced use

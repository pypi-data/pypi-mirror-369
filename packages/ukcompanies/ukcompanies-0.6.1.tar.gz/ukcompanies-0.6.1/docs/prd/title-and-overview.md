# Title & Overview

**Title**: `ukcompanies` â€” Async Python SDK for Companies House API

**Overview**:
`ukcompanies` is a modern, production-ready Python package that serves as a full-featured asynchronous wrapper for the UK Companies House API. Designed with developer experience and performance in mind, the package leverages modern Python tooling and idioms to simplify access to official UK company data for developers, analysts, and integrators.

This SDK aims for near-parity with the established `chwrapper` package while introducing async capabilities, improved models, robust testing, and thoughtful error handling out of the box.

# Story 1.6: Retry Logic and Rate Limiting Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer using the ukcompanies SDK,
**I want** automatic retry logic for rate-limited requests,
**so that** my application can handle API rate limits gracefully without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Client supports automatic retry for 429 (rate-limited) responses
2. Configurable retry parameters: auto_retry, max_retries, backoff strategy
3. Exponential backoff with jitter implemented for retry delays
4. Fixed backoff strategy available as alternative option
5. Respect X-Ratelimit-Reset header for intelligent wait times
6. Optional on_retry callback for logging/monitoring retry attempts
7. Proper error propagation when max retries exceeded
8. Rate limit information extracted and included in RateLimitError
9. Retry logic is non-blocking and maintains async behavior
10. Unit tests achieve 100% coverage of retry module
11. Integration tests verify retry behavior with mocked 429 responses

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 (Filing History and Document Endpoints):
- Rate limit extraction patterns established in client methods
- RateLimitInfo model available for rate limit data
- Pattern for handling 429 responses in integration tests

From Story 1.2 (Core Client and Base Models):
- AsyncClient base class with request method that needs retry wrapping
- Exception hierarchy established with RateLimitError
- httpx.AsyncClient usage patterns established

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `src/ukcompanies/retry.py` - New retry logic module
- `src/ukcompanies/client.py` - Update AsyncClient to integrate retry logic
- `src/ukcompanies/exceptions.py` - Update RateLimitError with new fields
- `src/ukcompanies/config.py` - Add retry configuration constants
- `tests/unit/test_retry.py` - Unit tests for retry module
- `tests/integration/test_retry_logic.py` - Integration tests for retry behavior

### Retry Implementation Details
From PRD requirements [Source: prd/features.md#Retry-Logic]:
- Automatic retry for rate-limited requests (429 status)
- Configurable parameters:
  - `auto_retry`: Enable/disable automatic retries
  - `max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
  - `backoff`: Strategy ("exponential" or "fixed")
  - `on_retry`: Optional callback for logging
- Must respect `X-Ratelimit-Reset` for accurate delay

### Rate Limit Headers
From API documentation [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]:
- `X-Ratelimit-Remain`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed in window (600)
- `X-Ratelimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets
- Headers must be parsed and included in retry logic

### Backoff Strategies
From error handling strategy [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#External-API-Errors]:
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Max 3 retries by default, configurable via client
- Base delay calculation: `min(2^attempt * base_delay + jitter, max_delay)`
- Jitter range: 0-1 seconds randomly added
- Base delay: 1 second
- Max delay: 60 seconds

### Callback Signature
The on_retry callback should have this signature:
```python
async def on_retry(attempt: int, wait: float, response: httpx.Response) -> None:
    """
    Called before each retry attempt.
    
    Args:
        attempt: Retry attempt number (1-based)
        wait: Seconds to wait before retry
        response: The 429 response that triggered retry
    """
```

### Critical Implementation Rules
From coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Never use print() - use structlog logger exclusively
- All public methods must have type hints
- Use httpx.AsyncClient context manager properly
- Rate limit headers must always be checked and logged
- All async functions must be prefixed with async
- Never block the event loop with synchronous sleep

### Configuration Constants
Add to config.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```python
DEFAULT_AUTO_RETRY = True
DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3
DEFAULT_BACKOFF_STRATEGY = "exponential"
BASE_DELAY = 1.0  # seconds
MAX_DELAY = 60.0  # seconds
JITTER_RANGE = 1.0  # seconds
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of retry logic and rate limiting is **well-structured and comprehensive**. The developer has successfully created a robust retry system with exponential and fixed backoff strategies, proper rate limit header parsing, and excellent test coverage. The integration with the AsyncClient is clean and the exception-based flow is properly implemented. All acceptance criteria have been met with attention to detail.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/ukcompanies/retry.py
  - **Change**: Extracted mock response creation to a dedicated static method `_create_mock_429_response()`
  - **Why**: Code duplication - the mock response object was being created inline
  - **How**: This improves maintainability by centralizing the mock response creation logic and makes the code more testable

- **File**: src/ukcompanies/retry.py
  - **Change**: Removed unused variable `last_response` from `execute_with_retry` method
  - **Why**: Dead code - the variable was initialized but never used
  - **How**: Reduces cognitive load and keeps the code clean

- **File**: tests/unit/test_retry.py
  - **Change**: Updated unit tests to match the exception-based retry flow
  - **Why**: Tests were expecting response objects but the implementation uses exceptions
  - **How**: Changed tests to raise RateLimitError exceptions instead of returning mock responses with status codes

- **File**: tests/unit/test_exceptions.py
  - **Change**: Updated RateLimitError tests to use new attribute names
  - **Why**: Tests were using old attribute names (`remaining`, `limit`) instead of new ones (`rate_limit_remain`, `rate_limit_limit`)
  - **How**: Ensures tests accurately reflect the current implementation

- **File**: src/ukcompanies/retry.py
  - **Change**: Fixed all linting issues (imports, whitespace, type hints)
  - **Why**: Code quality and consistency with project standards
  - **How**: Updated imports to use `collections.abc`, cleaned whitespace, modernized type hints to use `|` union syntax

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards met, including proper use of structlog, type hints, and async patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed in correct locations as per architecture documentation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with excellent coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 11 acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Refactored retry.py to extract mock response creation method
[x] Fixed unit test compatibility with exception-based flow
[x] Removed unused variable from execute_with_retry
[x] Fixed all linting issues and modernized type hints
[x] Updated test assertions to match new RateLimitError attributes
[ ] Consider adding performance metrics collection for retry attempts (optional future enhancement)
[ ] Consider adding retry statistics to client for monitoring (optional future enhancement)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly:
- Validates all configuration parameters
- Handles exceptions gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Uses proper async patterns without blocking
- Respects rate limits to avoid API abuse

### Performance Considerations

The implementation is performant:
- Non-blocking async sleep for retries maintains application responsiveness
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd problems
- Respects X-Ratelimit-Reset header for intelligent wait times
- Configurable max_delay prevents excessive wait times
- Efficient exception handling with minimal overhead

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

Excellent implementation with all acceptance criteria met. The retry logic is robust, well-tested, and properly integrated into the client. Minor refactoring performed to improve code quality and maintainability. All tests passing (319 tests, 100% coverage on retry module).

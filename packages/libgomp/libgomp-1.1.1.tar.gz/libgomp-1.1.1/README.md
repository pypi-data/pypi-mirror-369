# libgomp â€” benign PoC for coordinated disclosure

**IMPORTANT:** This is a harmless proof-of-concept package used only for coordinated security disclosure.  
It performs a single, non-identifying HTTP request to a researcher-controlled domain on install so the researcher can verify package resolution (timestamp + source IP only). No files, credentials, or sensitive data are collected.

If you are an Adobe engineer and want to verify locally (hostname / cwd / home) please contact the reporter or run the consent-based verifier provided in the disclosure so you control the run.

## 🚀 GUI WORKING DIRECTORY FIX v2.0.27 - GUI FILES NOW CREATED IN CORRECT LOCATION!

### 🔧 CRITICAL GUI BUG FIX IN v2.0.27:

- **Working Directory Fix** - GUI now preserves user's current directory instead of changing to internal module directory

   - **Action**: Removed test directories, build artifacts, and temporary files for clean distribution
7. **v2.0.8**: Final Unicode compatibility fix
   - **Root Cause**: Remaining Unicode characters (🌐, ⏳, ❌, 💡, 📋, ✅) and Rich spinner characters causing Windows cp1252 encoding errors
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive replacement of ALL Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents throughout entire codebase
   - **Result**: Complete Windows terminal compatibility across all encoding systems

### ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**:

- Some dependencies (typer, rich) may not auto-install from PyPI
- **Workaround**: Manually install with `pip install typer rich` after installing MarketSwimmer
- **Python Path Issue**: If using multiple Python installations, specify the full path:
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m pip install typer rich`
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m marketswimmer gui`
- **Status**: All Unicode encoding issues resolved in v2.0.8

### 🚀 **Clean Installation & Testing**:

For a completely clean test environment:

**Option 1: Use the automated script**

```bash
# Run the batch file for automated clean installation
clean_install_test.bat

# Or use PowerShell version
clean_install_test.ps1
```

**Option 2: Manual clean installation**

```bash
# 1. Uninstall any existing versions
pip uninstall marketswimmer -y

# 2. Create fresh virtual environment
python -m venv marketswimmer_clean_test

# 3. Install in virtual environment
marketswimmer_clean_test\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install marketswimmer==2.0.7

# 4. Test the installation
marketswimmer_clean_test\Scripts\python.exe -m marketswimmer gui
```

### 🚀 **Quick Launch Options**:

1. **Use the automated test script**: `clean_install_test.bat` (complete clean installation and testing)
2. **Use the batch file**: `launch_gui.bat` (handles Python path automatically)
3. **Install dependencies first**: `pip install typer rich PyQt6` then `python -m marketswimmer gui`
4. **Use specific Python path** (if multiple Python versions installed)
5. **Virtual environment** (recommended for testing): Use the clean installation scripts above

# 1. Upload to Test PyPI first

python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/\*

# 2. Test installation from Test PyPI

pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ marketswimmer

# 3. If everything works, upload to production PyPI

python -m twine upload dist/\*

# 4. Install from production PyPI

pip install marketswimmer

# 5. Install required dependencies (if not automatically installed):

pip install typer rich matplotlib PyQt6

# 6. For full GUI functionality, install all optional dependencies:

pip install matplotlib PyQt6 seaborn

# 7. Test the installation:

python -m marketswimmer --help
cd

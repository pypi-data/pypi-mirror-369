  abstract = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},

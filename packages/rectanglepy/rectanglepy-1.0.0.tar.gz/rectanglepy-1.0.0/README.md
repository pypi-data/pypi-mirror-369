Rectangle is an open-source Python package for single-cell-informed cell-type deconvolution of bulk and spatial transcriptomic data, which is part of the [scverse ecosystem](https://scverse.org/packages/).

Rectangle presents a novel approach to second-generation deconvolution, characterized by hierarchical signature building for fine-grained cell-type deconvolution, estimation and correction of unknown cellular content, and efficient handling of large-scale single-cell data during signature matrix computation.

Rectangle was developed to overcome the current challenges in cell-type deconvolution, providing a robust and accurate methodology while ensuring a low computational profile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites for Development

- Python 3.9+
- IDA Pro (for testing)
- UV for dependency management
- pytest for testing (included in dev dependencies)

### Setting up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HexRaysSA/ida-domain.git
   cd ida-domain
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export IDADIR="[Your IDA Installation Directory]"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies using UV**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
cd docs
uv run --with sphinx --with sphinx-rtd-theme --with sphinx-autodoc-typehints make html
```

The generated documentation will be available at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

## Making Changes

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below.

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Run existing tests
   uv run pytest tests/

   # Test with actual IDA binaries if possible
   python examples/explore_database.py -f /path/to/test/binary
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed:
   ```bash
   cd docs && make html
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork and create a Pull Request**.

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

### IDA Domain Specific Guidelines

- **Domain Model Patterns**: Follow existing patterns for domain entities
- **IDA Integration**: Ensure compatibility with IDA Python SDK
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception handling for IDA operations
- **Resource Management**: Properly handle database connections and cleanup
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Code Organization

- Keep related functionality in the same module
- Follow the existing package structure in `ida_domain/`
- Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
- Include examples for new functionality

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Update README.md template if adding new features
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Keep inline comments concise and meaningful
- Update the examples directory with relevant usage patterns

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Write tests for new functionality**: Every new feature must include comprehensive tests
- **Add checks to existing tests**: When modifying existing functionality, enhance existing tests with additional checks
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Test with different binary formats when possible
- Write unit tests for individual functions and methods
- Include edge case testing (empty inputs, invalid parameters, etc.)

### Test Structure

```bash
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ida_domain_test.py          # Main test suite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/                  # Test binaries and resources
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Instructions for rebuilding test binaries
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tiny.asm                # Comprehensive assembly test source
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test.bin                # Compiled test binary (from tiny.asm)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.til             # Type information library
```

### Working with Test Resources

The project includes a comprehensive test binary (`test.bin`) built from `tiny.asm` that covers:
- All x64 operand types (register, immediate, memory, SIB addressing)
- Various instruction patterns and data sizes
- Function calls, string operations, and vector instructions
- Edge cases for thorough API testing

To rebuild the test binary after modifying `tiny.asm`:
```bash
cd tests/resources
nasm -f elf64 tiny.asm -o test.bin
```

**Important**: After updating the test binary, ensure you make the necessary changes to existing tests to accommodate any new functionality or changes in the binary structure.

When adding new functionality, consider whether `tiny.asm` needs updates to test new operand types or instruction patterns.

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/ida_domain_test.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## Examples

### Adding New Examples

When adding new functionality, include examples in the `examples/` directory:

1. Create a new Python file in `examples/`
2. Follow the existing pattern with proper argument parsing
3. Include comprehensive docstrings
4. Test the example with real binaries
5. Update documentation to reference the new example
6. Update the unit tests to run also the new example

### Example Template

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Brief description of what this example demonstrates.

This example shows how to use IDA Domain to [specific functionality].
"""

import argparse
import ida_domain


def main_functionality(db_path):
    """Main function demonstrating the feature."""
    # Your implementation here
    pass


def main():
    """Main entry point with argument parsing."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Example description')
    parser.add_argument(
        '-f', '--input-file',
        help='Binary input file to be loaded',
        type=str,
        required=True
    )
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main_functionality(args.input_file)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Development Tips

### Working with IDA

```bash
# Set IDA directory for development
export IDADIR="/Applications/IDA Professional 9.1.app/Contents/MacOS/"

# Test with different binary types
python examples/explore_database.py -f tests/resources/test.bin
```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Format code
uv run black ida_domain/ examples/ tests/

# Run linting
uv run ruff check ida_domain/ examples/ tests/

# Type checking
uv run mypy ida_domain/

# Build package
uv build
```

### Debugging

- Use IDA's built-in debugging capabilities
- Add logging for complex operations
- Test with various binary formats and architectures
- Use the examples directory for quick testing

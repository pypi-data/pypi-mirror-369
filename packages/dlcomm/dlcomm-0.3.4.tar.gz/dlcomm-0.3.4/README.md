# Deep Learning Communication (DLcomm) Benchmark

**DLComm** is a communication benchmark designed for Deep Learning and AI workloads. Collective communication performance is often the primary bottleneck in AI training, inference, reasoning, and large-scale applications. DLComm emulates the communication patterns of the latest large language models (LLMs) and AI applications at scale, specifically targeting deployments of 50,000 GPUs and beyond.

The benchmark is provided as an executable that can be configured to test various communication patterns within different AI distributed runtime frameworks. It uses a modular design to support all levels of communicator groups across GPUs, with flexible configurations for payload sizes, AI frameworks, and collective communication backends. DLComm enables testing on diverse systems, supports modifying scale-up and scale-out algorithms, and verifies correctness after communication operations.

Unlike traditional communication benchmarks, DLComm is built with the philosophy of reflecting real-world communication performance of the application as accurately as possible. It captures the interplay between Python runtimes, AI frameworks, and collective communication libraries (CCL) to provide insights that are directly relevant to actual AI workloads.

The below gif shows a simple model of how different collective communications are performed over a group of GPUs. Update the below gif with a note - x axis is num_gpus_per_node and y axis is num_compute_nodes. Each sqaure is a GPU on a compute node. Each blinking bright rectangles could represent different collectives executing in an order.

## Installation and running DLCOMM

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install DLcomm

## Running the benchmark

## YAML configuration file

Workload characteristics for DL COMM are specified by a YAML configuration file. The main configuration file is located at `dl_comm/config/config.yaml`. A sample configuration file is also available in the `examples/config.yaml` for reference.

Below is an example configuration file

```yaml
framework  : pytorch  # tensorflow / jax / titan / monarch
ccl_backend : ccl   # rccl / nccl / xccl (Note: PyTorch 2.7+ users should use 'xccl' instead of 'ccl' for Intel oneCCL)
ccl_debug   : on # on / off - enables CCL debug logging and algorithm selection reporting
use_profiler: unitrace
barrier     : on    # on / off - on: adds MPI barrier before timer printing for accurate timing, off: only rank 0 prints

### Important Note for PyTorch Users

**Backend Naming**: The `ccl_backend` field naming depends on your PyTorch version:

- **PyTorch < 2.7**: Use `ccl_backend: ccl` for Intel oneCCL
- **PyTorch 2.7+**: Use `ccl_backend: xccl` for Intel oneCCL

Make sure to use the correct backend name for your PyTorch version to avoid initialization errors.

## Correctness Verification

DLComm includes built-in correctness verification for all collective operations. When `verify_correctness: on` is set in the configuration:

- **Verification Scope**: Correctness is checked on **all iterations** to ensure consistent behavior
- **Failure-Only Reporting**: Correctness results are **only printed when failures occur** to reduce log noise
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Failed verifications include iteration number and specific rank information
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All collective operations (AllReduce, AllGather, ReduceScatter, etc.) are validated

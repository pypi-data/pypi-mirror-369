To switch from Poetry to UV, you need to refactor your `pyproject.toml` to use the standard PEP 621 `[project]` table and `[build-system]` configuration. This involves:

1.  Migrating project metadata, dependencies, and script entry points from Poetry's specific `[tool.poetry]` format to `[project]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
2.  Adjusting version specifiers to common PEP 440 formats (e.g., `~=` or `>=`).
3.  Updating the `[build-system]` to use `setuptools`, which is a common build backend compatible with UV.
4.  Removing Poetry-specific configurations like `include` and the path-based `pyontoenv` dependency, as these are handled differently with standard build tools and UV.

Brick requires Python >= 3.6. We use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run code formatters and style checkers when you commit.

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage packaging and dependencies. After installing poetry, install dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

Enter the development environment with the following command (this is analogous to activating a virtual environment.

```bash
poetry shell

#### update the github action to use uv instead of poetry  

To update the GitHub Action workflow to use uv instead of Poetry, I will modify `.github/workflows/builds.yml`.

The changes involve:
1.  Replacing the Poetry installation step with `astral-sh/setup-uv` for installing uv and setting up Python versions.
2.  Removing the separate `actions/setup-python` step as `setup-uv` handles Python installation.
3.  Updating the dependency installation commands from `poetry install` to `uv sync`.
4.  Updating the test command to use `uv run pytest`.

#### when using 'expand', default to the 'topquadrant' engine if it is available, else fallback to 'pyshacl'  

To implement the requested change, I will modify the `expand` method in `brickschema/graph.py`. The `shacl` profile will now default to using the 'topquadrant' engine if the `brick_tq_shacl` package is available. If it's not available, or if 'pyshacl' is explicitly specified, it will fall back to using 'pyshacl'.

#### clean up and fix the logic for validate and expand so that they use the fastest engine available. For "owlrl" the fastest engines are: reasonable, allegrograph, owlrl. For "shacl" the fastest engines are: topquadrant, pyshacl.  

I will clean up the logic in the `validate` and `expand` methods in `brickschema/graph.py` to automatically use the fastest available engine when one is not specified.

For the `validate` method and for SHACL-based operations in the `expand` method, I will implement a check for the `topquadrant` engine (`brick_tq_shacl`) and use it if available, falling back to `pyshacl` otherwise.

For OWLRL-based operations in the `expand` method, I will set `reasonable` as the default backend, which is the fastest. I will also fix the logic to ensure that the selected backend is actually used for inference, and that inference is performed only for the appropriate profiles (`owlrl`, `vbis`).

Here are the required changes:

#### /add brickschema/graph.py  
> Added brickschema/graph.py to the chat  

#### add a min_iterations and max_iterations to the graph.expand function, which will get used in the shacl part. the brick-tq-shacl infer method takes min_iterations and max_iterations as arguments. pyshacl doesn't, so we will need to emulate that ourselves  

I will update `brickschema/graph.py` to add `min_iterations` and `max_iterations` to the `expand` function and use them for SHACL-based inference.

Here are the required changes:

First, I'll update the signature of the `expand` method to accept the new iteration parameters.

```python
brickschema/graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def expand(
        self, profile, backend=None, simplify=True, ontology_graph=None, iterative=True
    ):
=======
    def expand(
        self,
        profile,
        backend=None,
        simplify=True,
        ontology_graph=None,
        iterative=True,
        min_iterations=1,
        max_iterations=10,
    ):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, I'll remove the now-redundant `_iterative_expand` helper method.

```python
brickschema/graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _iterative_expand(self, og: "Graph"):
        old_size = len(self)
        for _ in range(3):
            valid, _, report = pyshacl.validate(
                data_graph=self,
                shacl_graph=og,
                ont_graph=og,
                advanced=True,
                allow_warnings=True,
                abort_on_first=True,
                inplace=True,
            )
            if not valid:
                logger.warn(report)
            if len(self) == old_size:
                break

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

I'll update the recursive call inside `expand` to pass along the new parameters.

```python
brickschema/graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if "+" in profile:
            for prf in profile.split("+"):
                self.expand(
                    prf,
                    backend=backend,
                    simplify=simplify,
                    ontology_graph=og,
                    iterative=iterative,
                )
            return
=======
        if "+" in profile:
            for prf in profile.split("+"):
                self.expand(
                    prf,
                    backend=backend,
                    simplify=simplify,
                    ontology_graph=og,
                    iterative=iterative,
                    min_iterations=min_iterations,
                    max_iterations=max_iterations,
                )
            return
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, I'll update the SHACL profile implementation to use the new iteration parameters for both the `topquadrant` and `pyshacl` backends. For `pyshacl`, this involves implementing the iteration logic directly within the `expand` method.

```python
brickschema/graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif profile == "shacl":
            shacl_backend = backend
            if shacl_backend is None:

#### let's actually move the SHACL expansion stuff to a new method called "compile". Keep the owl stuff where it is  

Of course. I will refactor the `expand` method by moving the SHACL-related logic to a new `compile` method.

Here are the edits for `brickschema/graph.py`:

First, I'll add the new `compile` method to the `BrickBase` class, which will contain the SHACL expansion logic previously in the `expand` method.

```python
brickschema/graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return [
            os.path.basename(x)[len("Brick-") : -len("-alignment.ttl")]
            for x in alignments
        ]

#### add the same min/max iterations to the shacl validation function  

Of course. I will add `min_iterations` and `max_iterations` to the `validate` method in `brickschema/graph.py`.

For the `pyshacl` engine, which does not support iterative validation, I will add a warning if iteration is requested. For the `topquadrant` engine, I will pass these new parameters to the underlying `validate` call.

#### switch to using importlib.util.find_spec for brick-tq-shacl  

Of course. I'll switch to using `importlib.util.find_spec` to check for the `brick-tq-shacl` package.

I will modify `brickschema/graph.py` to:
1.  Import the `importlib.util` module.
2.  Update the `validate()` method to use `importlib.util.find_spec` to check for `brick-tq-shacl`.
3.  Update the `compile()` method to also use `importlib.util.find_spec`.

Of course. I will rewrite the tests that use SHACL-based inference to use the new `compile` method instead of `expand`. This affects test files `tests/test_inference.py` and `tests/test_persistent_graph.py`.

Here are the required changes:

In `tests/test_inference.py`, I'll update three test cases to call `compile()` instead of `expand(profile="shacl")`.

    r = g.query("SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x rdf:type brick:Air_Temperature_Sensor }")
=======
    data = pkgutil.get_data(__name__, "data/brick_inference_test.ttl").decode()
    g.load_file(source=io.StringIO(data))

    g.compile(backend="pyshacl")

    r = g.query("SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x rdf:type brick:Air_Temperature_Sensor }")

```python

    graph = Graph(load_brick=True).from_triples(
        [(EX["a"], RDF.type, BRICK.Air_Flow_Setpoint)]
    )
    graph.expand(profile="shacl", backend="topquadrant")

    res1 = graph.query(

    graph = Graph(load_brick=True).from_triples(

    )

In `tests/test_persistent_graph.py`, I'll make a similar update to `test_persistent_graph`.

```python
tests/test_persistent_graph.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pg.add((EX["a"], A, BRICK.Temperature_Sensor))
    pg.expand("shacl", backend="pyshacl")
    pg.serialize("/tmp/out.ttl", format="turtle")
=======
    pg.add((EX["a"], A, BRICK.Temperature_Sensor))
    pg.compile(backend="pyshacl")
    pg.serialize("/tmp/out.ttl", format="turtle")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

To see the effects of these changes, you can run the test suite.

```bash
pytest
```

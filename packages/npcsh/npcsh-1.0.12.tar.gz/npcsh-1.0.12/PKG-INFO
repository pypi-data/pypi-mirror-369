# NPC Shell

The NPC shell is a suite of executable command-line programs that allow users to easily interact with NPCs and LLMs through a command line shell. 

Programs within the NPC shell use the properties defined in `~/.npcshrc`, which is generated upon installation and running of `npcsh` for the first time.

To get started:
```
pip install 'npcsh[local]'
```
Once installed, the following CLI tools will be available: `npcsh`, `guac`, `npc` cli, `yap` `pti`, `wander`, and `spool`. 


## npcsh
- a bash-replacement shell (`npcsh`) that can process bash, natural language, or special macro calls. `npcsh` detects whether input is bash or natural language and processes it accordingly. 
    
    - Users can specify whether natural language commands are processed in one of three ways:
        - agentically (i.e. an NPC reviews and decides to pass to other NPCs or to use NPC tools called `jinxs` (short for Jinja Template Executions) to carry out tasks.
        - conversationally (the NPC generates a response which the user can approve to run) 
        - directly through bash execution (the NPC responds by generating executable bash code which is then processed automatically in the shell.
    
        Switching between the modes within the session is straightforward and the user can specify the default mode in the `.npcshrc` file described in greater detail below. The default mode is agentic, but the user can switch by typing `/chat` to switch to conversational mode or `/cmd` to switch to bash execution mode.
    
    - Web searching     
        ```
        /search -p perplexity 'cal bears football schedule'
        ```
    - One shot sampling 
        ```
        /sample 'prompt'
        ```

    - Image generation:      
        ```
        /vixynt 'an image of a dog eating a hat'
        ```
        
    - Process Identification:       
        ```    
        please identify the process consuming the most memory on my computer
        ```    
    - Screenshot analysis:     
        ```
        /ots
        ```
    - voice chat:     
        ```
        /yap
        ```
    - Computer use:     
        ```
        /plonk -n 'npc_name' -sp 'task for plonk to carry out '
        ```
    - Enter chat loop with an NPC:     
        ```
        /spool -n <npc_name>
        ```

## `guac`

<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/guac.md"> 
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/guac.png" alt="npcsh logo of a solarpunk sign", width=250></a>
</p> 

- a replacement shell for interpreters like python/r/node/julia with an avocado input marker ðŸ¥‘ that brings a pomodoro-like approach to interactive coding. 
    - Simulation:      
        `ðŸ¥‘ Make a markov chain simulation of a random walk in 2D space with 1000 steps and visualize`
        ```
        # Generated python code:
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Number of steps
        n_steps = 1000

        # Possible moves: up, down, left, right
        moves = np.array([[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]])

        # Initialize position array
        positions = np.zeros((n_steps+1, 2), dtype=int)

        # Generate random moves
        for i in range(1, n_steps+1):
            step = moves[np.random.choice(4)]
            positions[i] = positions[i-1] + step

        # Plot the random walk
        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
        plt.plot(positions[:, 0], positions[:, 1], lw=1)
        plt.scatter([positions[0, 0]], [positions[0, 1]], color='green', label='Start')
        plt.scatter([positions[-1, 0]], [positions[-1, 1]], color='red', label='End')
        plt.title('2D Random Walk - 1000 Steps (Markov Chain)')
        plt.xlabel('X Position')
        plt.ylabel('Y Position')
        plt.legend()
        plt.grid(True)
        plt.axis('equal')
        plt.show()
        # Generated code executed successfully
      
        ```

        </p>
        
        Access the variables created in the code:    
        `ðŸ¥‘ print(positions)`
        ```
        [[  0   0]
        [  0  -1]
        [ -1  -1]
        ...
        [ 29 -23]
        [ 28 -23]
        [ 27 -23]]
        ```
     
    - Run a python script:   
        `ðŸ¥‘ run file.py`    
    - Refresh:    
        `ðŸ¥‘ /refresh`       
    - Show current variables:    
        `ðŸ¥‘ /show`    

    A guac session progresses through a series of stages, each of equal length. Each stage adjusts the emoji input prompt. Once the stages have passed, it is time to refresh. Stage 1: `ðŸ¥‘`, Stage 2: `ðŸ¥‘ðŸ”ª` Stage 3: `ðŸ¥‘ðŸ¥£` Stage:4 `ðŸ¥‘ðŸ¥£ðŸ§‚`, `Stage 5: ðŸ¥˜ TIME TO REFRESH`. At stage 5, the user is reminded to refresh with the /refresh macro. This will evaluate the session so farand suggest and implement new functions or automations that will aid in future sessions, with the ultimate approval of the user.

 
## `npc`
- A command line interface offering the capabilities of the npc shell from a regular bash shell. Our mascot agent Sibiji the spider will help you weave your agent web with the `npc` CLI.

- The NPC CLI lets users iterate and experiment with AI through bash commands. Below is a cheat sheet that shows how to use the `npc` CLI.

  - **Ask a Generic Question**
    ```bash
    npc 'has there ever been a better pasta shape than bucatini?'
    ```
    ```
    .Loaded .env file...                                                                                                                                               
    Initializing database schema...                                                                                                                                                            
    Database schema initialization complete.                                                                                                                                                   
    Processing prompt: 'has there ever been a better pasta shape than bucatini?' with NPC: 'sibiji'...                                                                                         
    â€¢ Action chosen: answer_question                                                                                                                                                           
    â€¢ Explanation given: The question is a general opinion-based inquiry about pasta shapes and can be answered without external data or jinx invocation.                                      
    ...............................................................................                                                                                                            
    Bucatini is certainly a favorite for many due to its unique hollow center, which holds sauces beautifully. Whether it's "better" is subjective and depends on the dish and personal        
    preference. Shapes like orecchiette, rigatoni, or trofie excel in different recipes. Bucatini stands out for its versatility and texture, making it a top contender among pasta shapes!

    npc alicanto "What ethical considerations should guide AI development?" --exploration 0.5

    ```
    - Different output formats
    ```    
    npc alicanto "What is the future of remote work?" --format report
    ```
 
## `pti`
-  a reasoning REPL loop with explicit checks to request inputs from users following thinking traces.
 
<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/pti.md"> 
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/frederic4.png" alt="npcsh logo of frederic the bear and the pti logo", width=250></a>
</p>
Speak with frederic the bear who, once he's done thinking, asks you for input before trudging on so it can work with confidence.

```bash
pti
```


## `spool`
- a simple agentic REPL chat loop with a specified agent.

<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/spool.md"> 
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/spool.png" alt="logo for spool", width=250></a>
</p>

## `yap`


<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/yap.md"> 
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/yap.png" alt="logo for yap ", width=250></a>
</p>

- an agentic voice control loop with a specified agent. When launching `yap`, the user enters the typical `npcsh` agentic loop except that the system is waiting for either text or audio input.

```
yap 
```


## `wander` 

<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/wander.md">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/kadiefa.png" alt="logo for wander", width=250></a>
</p>
  A system for thinking outside of the box. From our testing, it appears gpt-4o-mini and gpt-series models in general appear to wander the most through various languages and ideas with high temperatures. Gemini models and many llama ones appear more stable despite high temps. Thinking models in general appear to be worse at this task.
  
  - Wander with an auto-generated environment  
    ```
    npc --model "gemini-2.0-flash"  --provider "gemini"  wander "how does the bar of a galaxy influence the the surrounding IGM?" \
      n-high-temp-streams=10 \
      high-temp=1.95 \
      low-temp=0.4 \
      sample-rate=0.5 \
      interruption-likelihood=1


    ```
  - Specify a custom environment
    ```

    npc --model "gpt-4o-mini"  --provider "openai"  wander "how does the goos-hanchen effect impact neutron scattering?" \
      environment='a ships library in the south.' \
      num-events=3 \
      n-high-temp-streams=10 \
      high-temp=1.95 \
      low-temp=0.4 \
      sample-rate=0.5 \
      interruption-likelihood=1

    ```
  - Control event generation
    ```
    npc wander "what is the goos hanchen effect and does it affect water refraction?" \
    --provider "ollama" \
    --model "deepseek-r1:32b" \
    environment="a vast, dark ocean ." \
    interruption-likelihood=.1



    ```





## Inference Capabilities
- `npcsh` works with local and enterprise LLM providers through its LiteLLM integration, allowing users to run inference from Ollama, LMStudio, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Deepseek, making it a versatile tool for both simple commands and sophisticated AI-driven tasks.

## Startup Configuration and Project Structure
After `npcsh` has been pip installed, `npcsh`, `guac`, `pti`, `spool`, `yap` and the `npc` CLI can be used as command line tools. To initialize these correctly, first start by starting the NPC shell:
```bash
npcsh
```
When initialized, `npcsh` will generate a .npcshrc file in your home directory that stores your npcsh settings.
Here is an example of what the .npcshrc file might look like after this has been run.
```bash
# NPCSH Configuration File
export NPCSH_INITIALIZED=1
export NPCSH_CHAT_PROVIDER='ollama'
export NPCSH_CHAT_MODEL='llama3.2'
export NPCSH_DB_PATH='~/npcsh_history.db'
```

`npcsh` also comes with a set of jinxs and NPCs that are used in processing. It will generate a folder at ~/.npcsh/ that contains the tools and NPCs that are used in the shell and these will be used in the absence of other project-specific ones. Additionally, `npcsh` records interactions and compiled information about npcs within a local SQLite database at the path specified in the .npcshrc file. This will default to ~/npcsh_history.db if not specified. When the data mode is used to load or analyze data in CSVs or PDFs, these data will be stored in the same database for future reference.

The installer will automatically add this file to your shell config, but if it does not do so successfully for whatever reason you can add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
# Source NPCSH configuration
if [ -f ~/.npcshrc ]; then
    . ~/.npcshrc
fi
```

We support inference via all providers supported by litellm. For openai-compatible providers that are not explicitly named in litellm, use simply `openai-like` as the provider. The default provider must be one of `['openai','anthropic','ollama', 'gemini', 'deepseek', 'openai-like']` and the model must be one available from those providers.

To use tools that require API keys, create an `.env` file in the folder where you are working or place relevant API keys as env variables in your ~/.npcshrc. If you already have these API keys set in a ~/.bashrc or a ~/.zshrc or similar files, you need not additionally add them to ~/.npcshrc or to an `.env` file. Here is an example of what an `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_deepseek_key'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_key'
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_perplexity_key'
```


 Individual npcs can also be set to use different models and providers by setting the `model` and `provider` keys in the npc files.
 Once initialized and set up, you will find the following in your ~/.npcsh directory:
```bash
~/.npcsh/
â”œâ”€â”€ npc_team/           # Global NPCs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ jinxs/          # Global tools

For cases where you wish to set up a project specific set of NPCs, jinxs, and assembly lines, add a `npc_team` directory to your project and `npcsh` should be able to pick up on its presence, like so:
```bash
./npc_team/            # Project-specific NPCs
â”œâ”€â”€ jinxs/             # Project jinxs #example jinx next
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.jinx
â””â”€â”€ assembly_lines/    # Project workflows
    â””â”€â”€ example.pipe
â””â”€â”€ models/    # Project workflows
    â””â”€â”€ example.model
â””â”€â”€ example1.npc        # Example NPC
â””â”€â”€ example2.npc        # Example NPC
â””â”€â”€ team.ctx            # Example ctx


```

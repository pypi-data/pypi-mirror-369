"""Two-qubit depolarizing noise implementation.

This module provides depolarizing noise models for two-qubit operations,
applying random two-qubit Pauli errors to qubit pairs during
two-qubit gate operations like CNOT and CZ gates.

    """Apply two-qubit depolarizing noise to quantum operation.

    Applies depolarizing noise to two-qubit operations by randomly selecting
    fault combinations from the noise dictionary and applying them to the
    individual qubits of each two-qubit pair.

    Args:
        op: Quantum operation to apply noise to.
        p: Probability of noise occurring on each qubit pair.
        noise_dict: Dictionary mapping fault pair tuples to their probabilities.

    Returns:
        List of single-qubit noise operations to apply,
        or None if no noise is applied.

    Raises:

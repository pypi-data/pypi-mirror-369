def _average_time_alive(birth_times, death_times, t0, t1):
    '''
    Calculates the average population size in the time interval [`t0`, `t1`)
    from birth times and death times of individuals. This is a helper function for
    `population_size`, and may change or be removed in the future.

    'Average population size' is the sum over all individuals of the length of
    time each individual was alive in [`t0`, `t1`), divided by `t1 - t0`. For
    integer t0 and t1, this is equivalent to the average over all integer time
    steps in [t0, t1) of the number of individuals alive at that time step;
    however, this is not restricted to integer times.

    Time goes bacwards, so t1 is further in the past than t0 and birth times
    are greater than death times. Birth times and death times should already
    include an offset for the stage that individuals are remembered at. See
    `population_size` code.

    For example, suppose t0 = 1, t1 = 4, and there are four individuals with
    birth times [3, 1, 5, 4] and death times [0, 1, 2, 4]. The first individual
    is alive for three time steps in [t0, t1): 1, 2, and 3; the second
    individual for one time step: 1; the third individual for two time steps: 2
    and 3, and the fourth individual for zero (since the time interval is open
    on the right and it was born at t1). So the average population size is (3 +
    1 + 2 + 0)/(4-1) = 2.

    :param numpy.ndarray birth_times: Birth times of individuals.
    :param numpy.ndarray death_times: Death times of individuals. Should be the same
        length as `birth_times`. Death times are less than or equal to birth times.
    :param float t0: Lower time endpoint.
    :param float t1: Upper time endpoint. t1 is greater than t0.

    # was alive for, i.e., of the intersection with [birth, death].

def population_size(ts, x_bins, y_bins, time_bins, stage='late', remembered_stage=None):
    '''
    Calculates the population size in each of the spatial bins defined by grid lines
    at ``x_bins`` and ``y_bins``, averaged over each of the time intervals separated by
    ``time_bins``. To obtain actual (census) sizes, the tree sequence must contain
    all individuals alive, e.g., from a SLiM simulation with all individuals
    permanently remembered.

    With ``nx``, ``ny`` and ``nt`` the number of bins in the ``x``, ``y`` and time directions
    (so, ``nx`` is one less than the length of ``x_bins``),
    returns a 3-d array with dimensions ``(nx, ny, nt)``.
    The ``(i,j,k)``th element of the array is the average number of
    individuals with ``x`` coordinate in the half-open interval ``[x_bins[i], x_bins[i + 1])``
    and ``y`` coordinate in the half-open interval ``[y_bins[i], y_bins[i + 1])``,
    averaged across all times in the half-open interval ``[time_bins[k], time_bins[k + 1])``.

    For integer endpoints of the time bins, this average is equivalent to
    recording the number of indivduals that are alive at each time in the time
    interval and have location in the relevant location bin, then taking the
    mean of these recorded population sizes.

        the time bins refer to (either "early" or "late"; defaults to "late").
    :param str remembered_stage: The stage in the SLiM life cycle during which
        individuals were Remembered (defaults to the stage the tree sequence was
        recorded at, stored in metadata).

## ðŸ”® Future Development

### Candidate Features for Upcoming Releases

**Philosophy:** Small, practical improvements that provide immediate value to users. Features will be selected based on user feedback, development bandwidth, and priority.

#### User Experience Enhancements
*   [ ] **Custom title support:** `--title "My Project Dependencies"`
    *   **Use Case:** Personalize diagrams with meaningful project names
*   [ ] **Progress indicators:** Simple feedback during long operations
    *   **Implementation:** "Parsing dependencies..." â†’ "Generating diagram..." â†’ "Done!"
#### Configuration & Customization
*   [ ] **Configuration file support:** `.mvnviz.conf` file for default options
    *   **Use Case:** Avoid typing same flags repeatedly, team consistency
*   [ ] **`--exclude-scopes` option:** Filter out test, provided, or other scopes
*   [ ] **`--max-depth` option:** Limit dependency tree depth for overview mode

#### Output & Analysis Improvements
*   [ ] **Basic dependency statistics:** Show total counts in CLI output and HTML comments

#### Enterprise & Integration Features
*   [ ] **Docker container:** Official container images for CI/CD
*   [ ] **GitHub Actions integration:** Pre-built actions for automated diagram generation

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Ongoing Improvements
*   **Performance Optimization:** Continuous improvements for larger and more complex projects
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with all major browsers and versions
*   **Accessibility:** Enhanced accessibility features for users with disabilities
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation and developer guides

### Code Quality
*   **Test Coverage:** Maintain high test coverage with focus on edge cases
*   **Type Safety:** Full type annotation coverage and strict type checking
*   **Security:** Regular security audits and dependency updates
*   **Performance:** Continuous profiling and optimization of critical paths

**Focus:** Advanced analysis and integration features.

*   **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   [ ] Dependency conflict detection and highlighting
    *   [ ] Dependency statistics and analysis
    *   [ ] Version mismatch warnings
*   **Integration Capabilities:**
    *   [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration examples
    *   [ ] Docker support and containerization
    *   [ ] Maven plugin version (if demand exists)

## Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months+)

*   **Web-Based Version:** A web-based version where users can paste their dependency tree and get a visualization without installing the CLI.
*   **IDE Integration:** Plugins for VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse for direct dependency visualization.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Extend beyond Maven to support Gradle, npm, pip, etc.

## Release Strategy

Each release follows this approach:
- **Incremental Value:** Each version adds meaningful value without breaking existing functionality
- **User-Driven:** Priority based on user feedback and common pain points
- **Quality First:** New features include comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Backward Compatibility:** CLI interface remains stable across minor versions
- **Small & Focused:** Features are kept small and manageable for faster delivery
- **Feature Selection:** Features are chosen from the candidate list based on current priorities and available development time

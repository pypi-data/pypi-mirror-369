# How To Contribute
## Features
If Blizzard adds a new API endpoint and you get to it before I do, feel free to open a PR. There are a few things I ask if you contribute:
<ul>Follow the conventions already in the code -- keep everything uniform.</ul>
<ul>If you write an API endpoint function, write its accompanying test in the proper file.</ul>
<ul>black is the preferred formatting system for this project</ul>

## Bugs
I'm a hobbyist with Python so there's a decent chance I'll make a mistake. I run PyTest against every function I write, but that won't catch everything.
When you submit a PR that fixes a bug, be clear about what the bug is and how your changes fix it.
Follow the same guidelines as you would if you were submitting a feature.

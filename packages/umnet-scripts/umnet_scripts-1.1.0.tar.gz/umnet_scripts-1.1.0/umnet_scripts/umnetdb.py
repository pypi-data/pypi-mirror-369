        Generic 'select' query string builder built from standard query components as input.
        The user is required to generate substrings for the more complex inputs
        (eg joins, where statements), this function just puts all the components
        together in the right order with appropriately-added newlines (for debugging purposes)
        and returns the result.

        :select: a list of columns to select
          ex: ["nip.mac", "nip.ip", "n.switch", "n.port"]
        :table: a string representing a table (or comma-separated tables, with our without aliases)
          ex: "node_ip nip"
        :joins: a list of strings representing join statements. Include the actual 'join' part!
          ex: ["join node n on nip.mac = n.mac", "join device d on d.ip = n.switch"]
        :where: A list of 'where' statements without the 'where'. The list of statements are
          "anded". If you need "or", embed it in one of your list items

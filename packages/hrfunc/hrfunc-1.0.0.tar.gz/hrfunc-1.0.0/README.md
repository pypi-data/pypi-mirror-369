# HRFunc
HRFunc is a python preprocessing and modeling tool for estimating neural activity from hemoglobin concentration through modeling hemodynamic response functions through the brain recorded from fNIRS signals and deconvolving neural activity. Toeplitz deconvolution with Tikhonov regularization is employed for HRF and neural activity estimation.

**A lightweight, high-performance API framework for Python with the elegance of FastAPI and the speed of light.**

Tachyon API combines the intuitive decorator-based syntax you love with minimal dependencies and maximal performance. Built with Test-Driven Development from the ground up, it offers a cleaner, faster alternative with full ASGI compatibility.

```python
from tachyon_api import Tachyon
from tachyon_api.models import Struct

app = Tachyon()

class User(Struct):
    name: str
    age: int

@app.get("/")
def hello_world():
    return {"message": "Tachyon is running at lightspeed!"}

@app.post("/users")
def create_user(user: User):
    return {"created": user.name}
```

## üì¶ Installation

Tachyon API is currently in beta. The package will be available on PyPI and Poetry repositories soon!

### From source (Currently the only method)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmpanozzoz/tachyon_api.git
cd tachyon-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The `pip install tachyon-api` and `poetry add tachyon-api` commands will be available once the package is published to PyPI.

## üîç Key Differences from FastAPI

While inspired by FastAPI's elegant API design, Tachyon API takes a different approach in several key areas:

| Feature | Tachyon API | FastAPI |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Core Dependencies** | Minimalist: Starlette + msgspec + orjson | Pydantic + multiple dependencies |
| **Validation Engine** | msgspec (faster, lighter) | Pydantic (more features, heavier) |
| **Dependency Injection** | Both implicit and explicit | Primarily explicit |
| **Middleware Approach** | Dual API (class + decorator) | Class-based |
| **Development Approach** | Test-Driven from the start | Feature-driven |
| **Documentation UI** | Scalar UI (default), Swagger, ReDoc | Swagger UI (default), ReDoc |
| **Size** | Lightweight, focused | Comprehensive, full-featured |

## üß™ Test-Driven Development

Tachyon API is built with TDD principles at its core:

- Every feature starts with a test
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Self-contained test architecture
- Clear test documentation

This ensures stability, maintainability, and prevents regressions as the framework evolves.

## üîå Core Dependencies

Tachyon API maintains a minimal, carefully selected set of dependencies:

- **[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)**: ASGI framework providing solid foundations
- **[msgspec](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/)**: Ultra-fast serialization and validation
- **[orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson)**: High-performance JSON parser
- **[uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)**: ASGI server for development and production

These were chosen for their performance, lightweight nature, and focused functionality.

## üíâ Dependency Injection System

Tachyon API offers a flexible dependency injection system:

### Implicit Injection

```python
@injectable
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, repository: UserRepository):  # Auto-injected!
        self.repository = repository

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int, service: UserService):  # Auto-injected!
    return service.get_user(user_id)
```

### Explicit Injection

```python
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int, service: UserService = Depends()):
    return service.get_user(user_id)
```

## üîÑ Middleware Support

Tachyon API supports middlewares in two elegant ways:

### Class-based Approach

```python
from tachyon_api.middlewares import CORSMiddleware, LoggerMiddleware

# Add built-in CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
    allow_credentials=False,
)

# Add built-in Logger middleware
app.add_middleware(
    LoggerMiddleware,
    include_headers=True,
    redact_headers=["authorization"],
)
```

### Decorator-based Approach

```python
@app.middleware()
async def timing_middleware(scope, receive, send, app):
    start_time = time.time()
    await app(scope, receive, send)
    print(f"Request took {time.time() - start_time:.4f}s")
```

### Built-in Middlewares

- CORSMiddleware: Handles preflight requests and injects CORS headers into responses. Highly configurable with allow_origins, allow_methods, allow_headers, allow_credentials, expose_headers, and max_age.
- LoggerMiddleware: Logs request start/end, duration, status code, and optionally headers and a non-intrusive body preview.

Both middlewares are standard ASGI middlewares and can be used with `app.add_middleware(...)`.

## üìö Example Application

For a complete example showcasing all features, see the [example directory](./example). It demonstrates:

- Clean architecture with models, services, and repositories
- Router organization
- Middleware implementation
- Dependency injection patterns
- OpenAPI documentation

Built-in CORS and Logger middlewares are integrated in the example for convenience. You can toggle settings in `example/app.py`.

Run the example with:

```bash
cd example
python app.py
```

Then visit:
- **API**: http://localhost:8000/
- **Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

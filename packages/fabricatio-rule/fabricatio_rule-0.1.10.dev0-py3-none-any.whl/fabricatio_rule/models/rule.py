"""A module containing classes related to rule sets and rules.

This module provides the `Rule` and `RuleSet` classes, which are used to define and manage
individual rules and collections of rules, respectively. These classes are designed to
facilitate the creation, organization, and application of rules in various contexts,
ensuring clarity, consistency, and enforceability. The module supports detailed
descriptions, examples, and metadata for each rule and rule set, making it suitable for
complex rule management systems.

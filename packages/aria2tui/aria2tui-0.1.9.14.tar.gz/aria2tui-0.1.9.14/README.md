# aria2tui

Aria2tui is a TUI download management tool. It acts as a front-end for the aria2c download utility, facilitating bulk downloading, torrenting, queue control, pausing and resuming downloads, fine-tuning download options (e.g., piece length, user-agent, max speed, etc.), downloading via proxy, and much more. 

Aria2tui communicates with the aria2c daemon over RPC. The UI is provided by my TUI picker [listpick](https://github.com/grimandgreedy/listpick).

## Quickstart

Install aria2tui using pip and add the config.toml file from ./src/aria2tui/data/ to your config directory.

```
python -m pip install aria2tui &&
mkdir ~/.config/aria2tui/ &&
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grimandgreedy/aria2tui/refs/heads/master/src/aria2tui/data/config.toml -O ~/.config/aria2tui/config.toml
```

**Note**: If you have not used aria2c before then download [this file](https://gist.github.com/qzm/a54559726896d5e6bf21adf2363ad334) and put it in ~/.config/aria2/. I would recommend going through and configuring it but this one will get you up and running for now.

After editing ~/.config/aria2tui/config.toml and ensuring that your url, port, and secret token are correct, you are all set to go:

```
aria2tui
```

If you have multiple daemons you can specify another config file:

```
ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria2c_torrents.toml aria2tui
ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria_on_home_server_config.toml aria2tui
```

If you wish to use it regularly, then it may be useful to add aliases to your ~/.bashrc.
```
alias a2="python /path/to/aria2tui/aria2tui.py"
alias a2t="ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria2c_torrents.toml aria2tui"
alias a2n="ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria_on_home_server_config.toml aria2tui"
```

in addition to those requirements the application uses:
 - `nvim` for viewing/editing download options as well as adding URIs, magnet links and torrent files
 - `xdg-open` and `gio` for opening files.

## Other installation options

### Git repo

Clone rep
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grimandgreedy/Aria2TUI
```

Copy config and edit it accordingly:
```bash
mkdir ~/.config/aria2tui &&
cp Aria2TUI/src/aria2tui/data/config.toml ~/.config/aria2tui
```
Install the requirements:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can start Aria2TUI:
```bash
cd ./Aria2TUI/src
python -m aria2tui.aria2tui_app
```

```bash
alias a2="cd /path/to/Aria2TUI/src && python -m aria2tui.aria2tui_app"
```

## Tips

 - Press '?' to see the help page which will list the available keys.
 - If you have problems starting aria2c, check that you have an aria2c config file at ~/.config/aria2/aria2.conf
 - By default aria2tui will track the download that the cursor is on. This is usually what you want. However, sometimes you want to stay at a particular place in the download queue--perhaps you want to remain at the top and watch the currently active downloads.
    - Press ~ and locate the **pin cursor (pc)** option.
      - Note: The pin symbol  will be shown in the footer to indicate the cursor tracking mode.
 - If you are performing bulk operations and the downloads are changing state rapidly--e.g., hundreds of images are changing from active/waiting to completed--it is recommended to **toggle the auto-refresh** option to ensure data integrity while selecting which downloads to operate upon.
    - This can be done by either:
      - exiting to the main menu ('q') and going to "View Downloads"; or
      - Pressing ~ and toggling auto-refresh.
    - Note: The refresh symbol  at the top right indicates that you are in auto-refresh mode.

## Important

While I use Aria2TUI every day, it is still in development and there are many things that still need to be cleaned up.

Some things that should be mentioned:

 - Realistically, Aria2TUI will only work in a UNIX (linux, macos) environment. If you register your interest I might be able to look into what I would need to change to get it to work on windows.
 - Note: This was created for personal use and so some of the code is quite ugly and/or buggy and simply needs to be re-written.

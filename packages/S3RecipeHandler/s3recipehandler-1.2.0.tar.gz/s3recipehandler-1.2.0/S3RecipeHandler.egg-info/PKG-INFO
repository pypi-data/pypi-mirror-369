# 🛹 Skate 3 Recipe File Library

This library provides tools to **serialize and deserialize Skate 3 Recipes**, which the game uses to define and construct skater data. These files contain everything needed to recreate a skater, from appearance to gear.

Whether you're analyzing skater data or building your own skater profiles, this library gives you full control over the binary format used by Skate 3.

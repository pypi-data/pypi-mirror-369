SQLObject Adapter is the [SQLObject](http://www.sqlobject.org/index.html) adapter for [PyCasbin](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin). With this library, Casbin can load policy from SQLObject supported database or save policy to it.

The current supported databases are:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Firebird
- Sybase
- MAX DB
- pyfirebirdsql

## Installation

```
pip install sqlobject_adapter
```

## Simple Example

```python
import sqlobject_adapter
import casbin

adapter = sqlobject_adapter.Adapter('sqlite:///test.db')

e = casbin.Enforcer('path/to/model.conf', adapter, True)

sub = "alice"  # the user that wants to access a resource.
obj = "data1"  # the resource that is going to be accessed.
act = "read"  # the operation that the user performs on the resource.

if e.enforce(sub, obj, act):
    # permit alice to read data1casbin_sqlalchemy_adapter
    pass
else:
    # deny the request, show an error
    pass
```

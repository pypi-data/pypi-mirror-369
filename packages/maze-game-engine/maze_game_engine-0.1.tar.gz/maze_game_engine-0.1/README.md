# Maze Game Engine
This is a basic engine for maze games. Currently, it supports mazes between one and eight dimensions; a user; and exit points.

This library has also served as my first GitHub repository (in 2021) and my first PyPi package (in 2025).

## Installation and Usage
1. Install [Python 3.10 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads) alongside its pip package manager.
2. Open a terminal of your choice and install the library:
```bash
pip install maze-game-engine -U
```
3. The library can now be imported to your projects and invoked as desired:
```py
import maze_game_engine as mge
...
```

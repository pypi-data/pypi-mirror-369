# ðŸ”¢ absolute_math

**absolute_math** is an open-source, extensible, and open-ended Python module for exploring the symbolic and structural properties of numbers.

It provides a collection of functions that analyze numerical identity, behavior, and transformationâ€”from primality and luck to symmetry, abundance, and orbit.

This module does not aim to be complete.  
It invites expansion, experimentation, and reinterpretation.  
The subject is mathematics.  
The rest is up to you.

To configure customer limits:

1.  Go to *Sales \> Products \> Discount & Loyalty* and select or create
    a new one.
2.  Set the *Maximum Customer Applications* to the number of times a
    program can be used by a customer.

NOTE: The customer limit is applied at commercial entity level, not for
each contact inside the entity.

To configure salesmen limits:

1.  Go to *Sales \> Products \> Discount & Loyalty* and select or create
    a new one.
2.  Add salesmen to the *Salesmen Limits* list and their maximum number
    of applications.
3.  You can add different limits to different salesmen groups.
4.  If you want to constrain the use of the promotion to the salesmen
    list, set the option *Strict limit* on, so any other salesman won't
    be able to apply the promotion.

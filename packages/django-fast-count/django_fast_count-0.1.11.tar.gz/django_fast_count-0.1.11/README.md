A fast [Django](https://djangoproject.com) `.count()` implementation for large tables.
## The Problem
For most databases, when a table grows to several million rows, the performance of the default `QuerySet.count()` can degrade significantly. This often becomes the slowest query in a view, sometimes by orders of magnitude. Since the Django admin app uses `.count()` on every list page, this can render the admin unusable for large tables.
## The Solution
`django-fast-count` provides a faster, plug-and-play, database-agnostic `.count()` implementation. It achieves this by strategically caching count results, using two main mechanisms:
1.  **Precaching**: Regularly caches counts for predefined querysets in the background.
2.  **Retroactive Caching**: Caches counts for any queryset if the result is large, immediately after the count is performed.
## Key Features
*   **Drop-in Replacement**: Simply replace your model's manager with `FastCountManager`.
*   **Configurable Caching**: Control cache duration, precache frequency, and thresholds.
*   **Background Precaching**: Precaching can be triggered to run in a background subprocess, minimizing impact on request-response cycles.
*   **Management Command**: Proactively precache counts and clean up expired entries.
*   **Extensible**: Designed for easy subclassing of `FastCountManager` and `FastCountQuerySet`.
*   **Django Cache Integration**: Leverages Django's cache framework for fast lookups before hitting the database cache.
## Installation
1.  Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install django-fast-count
    ```
2.  Add `django_fast_count` and `django.contrib.contenttypes` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    # settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... other apps
        "django.contrib.contenttypes",  # Required by django-fast-count
        "django_fast_count",
        # ... other apps
    ]
    ```
3.  Run migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    
## Basic Usage
To activate fast counts for a model, replace its default manager with `FastCountManager`.
```python
# models.py
from datetime import timedelta
from django.db.models import Model, BooleanField
from django_fast_count.managers import FastCountManager
class YourModel(Model):
    your_field = BooleanField(default=False)
    is_active = BooleanField(default=True)
    
    # Replace 'objects' manager
    objects = FastCountManager(
        precache_count_every=timedelta(hours=1),      # Default: 10 minutes
        cache_counts_larger_than=100_000,           # Default: 1,000,000
        expire_cached_counts_after=timedelta(hours=2), # Default: 10 minutes
        disable_forked_precaching=True,             # Optional: Defaults to False. Recommended: True for production.
    )
    
    # Optional: Define specific querysets to precache
    @classmethod
    def fast_count_querysets(cls):
        """
        Returns a list of querysets whose counts will be precached.
        By default, only cls.objects.all() is precached if this method is not defined.
        """
        return [
            cls.objects.filter(your_field=True),
            cls.objects.filter(your_field=False),
            cls.objects.filter(is_active=True).filter(your_field=True),
        ]
```
### `FastCountManager` Parameters
When initializing `FastCountManager`:
*   `precache_count_every` (timedelta): How often the querysets defined in `fast_count_querysets` (and the default `.all()`) should be re-counted and their results cached. Defaults to `timedelta(minutes=10)`.
*   `cache_counts_larger_than` (int): If a `.count()` query (that isn't already precached) returns a result greater than or equal to this number, that count will be retroactively cached. Defaults to `1,000,000`.
*   `expire_cached_counts_after` (timedelta): How long a cached count (both precached and retroactively cached) should remain valid. Defaults to `timedelta(minutes=10)`.
*   `precache_lock_timeout` (timedelta or int seconds): The timeout for the cache lock used to prevent multiple precaching processes from running simultaneously. Defaults to 1.5 times `precache_count_every` or 300 seconds, whichever is greater.
*   `disable_forked_precaching` (bool): If `True`, disables the automatic background precaching that is triggered by a `.count()` call. When disabled, precaching will *only* occur when the `precache_fast_counts` management command is run. This is recommended for production and serverless environments. Defaults to `False`.
### `fast_count_querysets(cls)`
This class method on your model allows you to specify a list of querysets that you want to be regularly precached.
*   If this method is not defined on your model, `django-fast-count` will only precache the count for `YourModel.objects.all()`.
*   The querysets returned by this method will have their counts calculated and stored during each precaching cycle.
## How it Works
### Caching Layers
`django-fast-count` uses a two-tier caching system for counts:
1.  **Django's Cache Framework**: The primary cache. When a count is requested, `django-fast-count` first checks Django's configured cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached). This is the fastest lookup.
2.  **Database Cache (`FastCount` model)**: If the count is not found in Django's cache, `django-fast-count` checks a dedicated database table (`django_fast_count_fastcount`). This table stores serialized counts, their hashes, and expiry times. If a valid entry is found here, it's used and also written back to Django's cache for future requests.
If a count is found in neither cache, the actual `COUNT(*)` query is executed against the database.
### Caching Mechanisms
*   **Precaching**:
    *   For querysets defined in `fast_count_querysets()` (and `YourModel.objects.all()`).
    *   Counts are updated periodically (defined by `precache_count_every`).
    *   This process is triggered automatically by any `.count()` call on the model or can be run manually via a management command.
*   **Retroactive Caching**:
    *   Applies to any `.count()` query performed on the model.
    *   If the actual count result is `cache_counts_larger_than` or more, the result is cached immediately after being calculated.
    *   This ensures that unexpectedly large, non-predefined counts also benefit from caching on subsequent requests.
### The `FastCount` Model
This model (`django_fast_count.models.FastCount`) stores the cached counts in your database. Key fields include:
*   `content_type`: Links to the model being counted.
*   `manager_name`: The name of the manager on the model (e.g., "objects").
*   `queryset_hash`: An MD5 hash of the SQL query, uniquely identifying the queryset.
*   `count`: The cached count value.
*   `last_updated`: Timestamp of the last cache update.
*   `expires_at`: Timestamp when the cache entry becomes stale.
*   `is_precached`: Boolean indicating if the entry was from precaching or retroactive caching.
### Cache Key Generation
A unique cache key is generated for each queryset based on:
*   The model's module and name.
*   The SQL query string generated by Django for the queryset.
*   The parameters used in the SQL query.
This string is then hashed (MD5) to create a stable `queryset_hash`.
## The Precaching Process
### Automatic Precaching (Background Subprocess)
*   When `YourModel.objects.count()` (or any count on a `FastCountManager`-backed queryset) is called, the system checks if it's time to run the precaching process for that model and manager (based on `precache_count_every`).
*   If precaching is due, and a lock can be acquired (to prevent multiple simultaneous runs), the `precache_fast_counts` **management command is launched as a background subprocess** (using `subprocess.Popen`).
*   This detached subprocess then executes the `precache_fast_counts` management command, which iterates through relevant models and managers to update their precached counts (querysets defined in `fast_count_querysets()` and the default `.all()` queryset).
*   **Note for Serverless Environments**: Since launching background subprocesses may not work reliably in serverless environments (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), it is highly recommended to disable this feature by setting `disable_forked_precaching=True` on your manager. In these environments, you should rely exclusively on running the `precache_fast_counts` management command via an external scheduler (e.g., AWS EventBridge, Google Cloud Scheduler).
### Manual Precaching (Management Command)
You can (and should, for reliability) set up a scheduled task (e.g., a cron job) to run the `precache_fast_counts` management command:
```bash
python manage.py precache_fast_counts
```
This command iterates through all models in your project, finds those using `FastCountManager`, and triggers their precaching logic. It also cleans up expired `FastCount` entries from the database.
## Advanced Usage: Subclassing
You can extend `FastCountManager` and `FastCountQuerySet` to add custom logic while retaining the fast counting capabilities.
### Subclassing `FastCountQuerySet`
If you need custom methods on your queryset:
```python
from django_fast_count.managers import FastCountQuerySet
class MyCustomQuerySet(FastCountQuerySet):
    
    def active(self):
        return self.filter(is_active=True)
    
    # If you override __init__, ensure you correctly handle manager_instance
    # and other FastCount settings, typically by passing them to super().
    # If you don't override __init__, the base FastCountQuerySet.__init__
    # will handle configuration from manager_instance automatically.
    #
    # def __init__(self, *args, my_custom_qs_param=None, **kwargs):
    #     # manager_instance should be in kwargs if passed from manager's get_queryset
    #     super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    #     self.my_custom_qs_param = my_custom_qs_param
```
### Subclassing `FastCountManager`
To use your custom queryset, your custom manager must override `get_queryset()`:
```python
from django_fast_count.managers import FastCountManager
# from .querysets import MyCustomQuerySet # Assuming MyCustomQuerySet is in querysets.py
class MyCustomManager(FastCountManager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        # Critical: Instantiate your custom queryset.
        # Pass `manager_instance=self` to ensure it's correctly configured
        # with model, db, and all FastCountManager settings.
        return MyCustomQuerySet(self.model, using=self._db, manager_instance=self)
    
    # Example of a custom manager method using the custom queryset
    def get_active_count(self):
        return self.get_queryset().active().count()
    
    # If you override __init__, call super and handle your custom params.
    # def __init__(self, *args, my_custom_mgr_param=None, **kwargs):
    #     super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) # Passes FC params like precache_count_every
    #     self.my_custom_mgr_param = my_custom_mgr_param
```
### Example: Using Custom Manager and QuerySet
```python
# models.py
from django.db import models
# from .managers import MyCustomManager # Assuming MyCustomManager is in managers.py
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    stock = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    
    objects = MyCustomManager() # Use your custom manager
    
    # fast_count_querysets can still be used with custom managers
    @classmethod
    def fast_count_querysets(cls):
        return [
            cls.objects.active(), # Uses MyCustomQuerySet.active()
            cls.objects.filter(stock__gt=0),
        ]
    
# Usage:
# Product.objects.count() # Uses fast count
# Product.objects.active().count() # Uses fast count for the filtered active products
# Product.objects.get_active_count() # Uses fast count via custom manager method
```
**Key for Subclassing `get_queryset()`**:
When overriding `get_queryset` in your `FastCountManager` subclass, ensure you instantiate your custom `FastCountQuerySet` subclass and pass `manager_instance=self` to its constructor. The `FastCountQuerySet` base class's `__init__` method uses `manager_instance` to correctly set up the `model`, database connection (`using`), and all fast-count configuration parameters (like `precache_count_every`, `cache_counts_larger_than`, etc.) that were defined on the manager instance.
## Configuration Reference
### `FastCountManager` Initialization Parameters:
*   `precache_count_every`: `timedelta`, default `timedelta(minutes=10)`.
*   `cache_counts_larger_than`: `int`, default `1,000,000`.
*   `expire_cached_counts_after`: `timedelta`, default `timedelta(minutes=10)`.
*   `precache_lock_timeout`: `timedelta` or `int` (seconds), default: `max(300, precache_count_every_seconds * 1.5)`.
*   `disable_forked_precaching`: `bool`, default `False`. If `True`, disables automatic background precaching triggered by `.count()` calls.
### Model `fast_count_querysets(cls)` Method:
*   Optional `classmethod` on your model.
*   Returns a list of `QuerySet` instances to be precached.
*   If not provided, only `YourModel.objects.all()` is precached.
### Environment Variables:
*   `DJANGO_FAST_COUNT_FORCE_SYNC_PRECACHE`: Set to `1` or `true` to run precaching synchronously in the current process when triggered by `maybe_trigger_precache()`, instead of launching a background subprocess. This is useful for testing or environments where background subprocesses are problematic.
## Management Commands
### `precache_fast_counts`
```bash
python manage.py precache_fast_counts
```
 
* Iterates through all registered Django models.
*   Identifies models using `FastCountManager` (or its subclasses).
*   For each identified manager, calls its `precache_counts()` logic. This involves:
    *   Getting the querysets from the model's `fast_count_querysets()` method (plus the default `.all()`).
    *   Executing `.count()` for each of these querysets.
    *   Storing the results in the `FastCount` database table and Django's cache.
*   Deletes any expired `FastCount` entries from the database.
*   It is recommended to run this command regularly via a scheduler (e.g., cron).
## Considerations & Limitations
*   **Stale Counts**: Cached counts can become stale between updates. The `expire_cached_counts_after` and `precache_count_every` settings control this trade-off between accuracy and performance.
*   **Serverless Environments**: The automatic background subprocess for precaching might not work reliably in serverless environments. Rely on the `precache_fast_counts` management command scheduled externally (e.g., AWS EventBridge, Google Cloud Scheduler).
*   **Complex Queries**: While `django-fast-count` aims to support most querysets, extremely complex or unusual query structures might have unforeseen interactions. Test thoroughly.
*   **Database Backend**: Designed to be database-agnostic, but performance characteristics of `COUNT(*)` can vary between databases. This package primarily addresses the overhead of Django's default counting for very large tables.

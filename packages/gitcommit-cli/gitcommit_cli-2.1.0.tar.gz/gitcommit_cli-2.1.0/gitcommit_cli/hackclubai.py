    Follow these guidelines to generate a high-quality commit message:

        * **Subject (summary):** imperative present, LESS THAN 80 chars, capitalize first word, no period. They should not be cut off.
        
        * **Body (optional):** blank line after subject; wrap ~200 chars; explain **what** + **why** (not how); add key context/side effects.
        
        * **Types (optional):** use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) with optional scope, e.g., `feat(parser): add array support`. Make sure to use the correct type for the commit message THESE ARE IMPORTANT.
        
        * **Atomic commits:** one purpose per commit; reference issue IDs, but don’t rely on them to explain intent.
        
        * **Think future:** messages should help teammates trace **why** a change happened and ease reviews/debugging.
        
        * **Footers:** issues, reviewers, breaking changes, etc.

        **Conventional Commits spec:** https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

        * **Purpose:** generate a concise, clear commit message based on the provided git diff. People should be able to tell what code was changed without opening the code and instead reading the commit message.

    **Template**

    ```

    ## <type>(<scope>): <Short imperative summary – less or equal to 80 chars>

    <Optional body ~200 chars>
    
    - Explain why this change is needed
    
    - Note side effects/context

    Issues: #123 (if applicable)
    Reviewed-by: Alice (if applicable)

    Example:

    ## feat(parser): add array support

    * Added support for parsing arrays in the configuration file.

    * This change allows users to define arrays in their config files, improving flexibility.

    * This is a breaking change as it changes the way arrays are handled in the parser.

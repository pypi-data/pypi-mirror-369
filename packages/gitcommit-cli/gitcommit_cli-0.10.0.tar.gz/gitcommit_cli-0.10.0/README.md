# commit-cli
gitcommit-cli is a CLI tool that auto-generates git commit messages by analyzing staged diffs with ai.hackclub.com or, if provided, an OpenAI key with ChatGPT. Preview the generated message and, in one smooth command, run git commit. Standardized style reduces friction, keeping your workflow focused and history clean.

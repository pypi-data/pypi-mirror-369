# This table is based on a homonym table provided by the Holos source code:
# https://github.com/holos-aafc/Holos/blob/main/H.Content/Resources/Table_22_Livestock_Coefficients_For_Sheep.csv
# For sake of simplicity, the original column names were changed as follows:
# * Cf (MJ d-1 kg-1) : cf
# * a (MJ kg-1): a
# * b (MJ kg-2): b
# * Initial Weight (kg): Initial Weight
# * Final Weight (kg): Final Weight
# * Wool Production (kg year-1): wool production
# the following column names were changed:
#   "NFLD" to "NL"
#   "PEI" to "PE"
#
# The original table along with the associated original notes follows in this comment:
# Sheep Class, Cf (MJ d-1 kg-1), a (MJ kg-1), b (MJ kg-2), Initial Weight (kg), Final Weight (kg), Wool Production (kg year-1)

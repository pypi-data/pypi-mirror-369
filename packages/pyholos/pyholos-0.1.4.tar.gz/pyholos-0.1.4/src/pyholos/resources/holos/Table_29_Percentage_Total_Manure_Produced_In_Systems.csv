# 1 "Source: ECCC (2022), Table A3.4-18",,,,
# 2 Calculated from Hofmann and Beaulieu (2006), Table A1 (for all values in Table A1, total manure production consists of feces and urine. Bedding and other types of material such as feather, unused feed, etc. are not included),,,,
# 3 Lorimor et al. (2004), Table 6,,,,
# 4 For geese, value for ducks used from Lorimor et al. (2004), Table 6,,,,
# 5 Assumes that manure handled by animal waste management system (AWMS) and manure excretion rate are the same for llamas and alpacas as for sheep and lambs,,,,
# 6 Identical distributions for manure handled by AWMS to non-dairy cattle, except that liquid systems are distributed to pasture, range and paddock (PRP),,,,
# 7 Assumes that manure handled by AWMS and manure excretion rate are the same for mules and asses as for horses,,,,

# The column title "Manureexcreted_rate (kg head-1 day-1)" was changed into "manure_excreted_rate"

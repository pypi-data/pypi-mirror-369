# Minimal Fallback Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a minimal fallback chunking system for Tree-sitter chunker Phase 8. This provides last-resort chunking for files without Tree-sitter grammar support.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Base Fallback System** (`chunker/fallback/base.py`)
   - `FallbackChunker`: Base class implementing the ChunkingStrategy interface
   - `FallbackWarning`: Custom warning class for fallback usage
   - Implements line-based, delimiter-based, and pattern-based chunking
   - Always emits warnings to encourage Tree-sitter usage

2. **File Type Detection** (`chunker/fallback/detection/file_type.py`)
   - `FileTypeDetector`: Detects file types using extensions, MIME types, and content patterns
   - `EncodingDetector`: Handles various text encodings automatically
   - Supports: text, log, markdown, csv, json, xml, yaml, config files
   - Binary file detection to avoid processing non-text files

3. **Chunking Strategies** (`chunker/fallback/strategies/`)
   - **LineBasedChunker**: Basic line-based chunking with overlap support
     - Adaptive chunking based on content density
     - Special CSV handling with header preservation
     - Config file section detection
   
   - **LogChunker**: Specialized for log files
     - Chunk by time windows
     - Chunk by severity levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, etc.)
     - Chunk by session/request IDs
     - Automatic timestamp format detection
   
   - **MarkdownChunker**: Markdown-specific chunking
     - Chunk by header hierarchy
     - Chunk by logical sections
     - Extract code blocks separately
     - Preserve document structure

4. **Fallback Manager** (`chunker/fallback/fallback_manager.py`)
   - Coordinates file type detection and chunking strategy selection
   - Provides high-level API for fallback chunking
   - Caches chunker instances for efficiency
   - Handles encoding detection and file reading

### Key Features

1. **Warning System**
   - All fallback usage emits `FallbackWarning`
   - Detailed messages explaining why fallback was used
   - Suggestions for Tree-sitter grammar repositories
   - Encourages users to request/contribute grammars

2. **Encoding Support**
   - Automatic encoding detection using chardet
   - Handles UTF-8, Latin-1, and other common encodings
   - Graceful fallback with error replacement

3. **File Type Support**
   - Text files (.txt)
   - Log files (.log, .out, .err)
   - Markdown (.md, .markdown)
   - CSV/TSV files
   - Configuration files (.ini, .cfg, .yaml, .json)
   - Binary file detection and rejection

4. **Chunking Methods**
   - Line-based with configurable size and overlap
   - Delimiter-based splitting
   - Regex pattern-based boundaries
   - Adaptive chunking based on content density
   - Specialized strategies per file type

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Warning emission verification
- File type detection accuracy
- Encoding detection and handling
- All chunking strategies
- Integration with fallback manager

### Documentation

- Detailed README in `chunker/fallback/README.md`
- API documentation in docstrings
- Demo script in `examples/fallback_demo.py`
- Clear limitations and best practices

## Usage Example

```python
from chunker.fallback import FallbackManager

manager = FallbackManager()

# Check if file can be chunked
if manager.can_chunk("data.log"):
    # Chunk file (emits warning)
    chunks = manager.chunk_file("data.log")
    
    for chunk in chunks:
        print(f"Chunk: {chunk.start_line}-{chunk.end_line}")
        print(f"Content: {chunk.content[:100]}...")
```

## Important Notes

1. **Last Resort Only**: This system should only be used when Tree-sitter cannot parse a file
2. **Always Warns**: Every use emits warnings to encourage proper grammar support
3. **No AST Awareness**: Cannot understand code structure, may split at inappropriate boundaries
4. **Text Only**: Binary files are detected and rejected

## Future Improvements

- Add more file type strategies (SQL, XML, etc.)
- Smarter content-based chunking
- Configuration file support
- Performance optimizations for large files

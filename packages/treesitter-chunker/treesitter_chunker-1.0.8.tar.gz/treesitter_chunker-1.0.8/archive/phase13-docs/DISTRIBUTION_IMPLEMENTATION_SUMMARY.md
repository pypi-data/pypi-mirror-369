# Distribution Component Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the Distribution component for Phase 13 of the treesitter-chunker project. This component handles package distribution across multiple platforms including PyPI, Docker, and Homebrew.

## Implemented Components

### 1. PyPI Publisher (`pypi_publisher.py`)
- Validates packages using twine check
- Supports both PyPI and TestPyPI repositories
- Handles dry-run mode for testing
- Checks for credentials via environment variables or .pypirc
- Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### 2. Docker Builder (`docker_builder.py`)
- Builds single-platform Docker images
- Supports multi-platform builds using Docker Buildx
- Automatically detects buildx availability
- Verifies Docker daemon is running
- Extracts and returns image IDs

### 3. Homebrew Formula Generator (`homebrew_generator.py`)
- Generates valid Homebrew formula files
- Validates semantic versioning
- Extracts package metadata from pyproject.toml
- Updates SHA256 hashes after package upload
- Validates formulas with or without brew installed

### 4. Release Manager (`release_manager.py`)
- Validates version bumps (must be higher than current)
- Updates version in multiple files (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, setup.py)
- Manages CHANGELOG.md updates
- Creates annotated git tags
- Builds release artifacts (sdist, wheel)
- Generates checksums for all artifacts
- Creates release notes from changelog

### 5. Installation Verifier (`verifier.py`)
- Tests pip installations in virtual environments
- Verifies conda installations
- Tests Docker container functionality
- Validates Homebrew installations on macOS
- Provides detailed test results for each platform

### 6. Main Distributor (`distributor.py`)
- Implements both DistributionContract and ReleaseManagementContract
- Integrates all components into a cohesive API
- Provides a full release workflow method
- Routes method calls to appropriate sub-components

## Contract Implementation

All methods defined in the contracts have been implemented:

**DistributionContract:**
- `publish_to_pypi()` ✓
- `build_docker_image()` ✓
- `create_homebrew_formula()` ✓
- `verify_installation()` ✓

**ReleaseManagementContract:**
- `prepare_release()` ✓
- `create_release_artifacts()` ✓

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests for each component:
- `test_pypi_publisher.py` - 6 tests
- `test_docker_builder.py` - 8 tests
- `test_homebrew_generator.py` - 10 tests
- `test_release_manager.py` - 10 tests
- `test_verifier.py` - 12 tests

Total: 46 unit tests, all passing

### Integration Tests
- Created `test_phase13_distribution_real.py` with 5 integration tests
- All integration tests pass with the actual implementation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Error Handling**: All methods return `(success: bool, info: dict)` tuples for consistent error handling

2. **Dependency Checking**: Each component checks for required tools (twine, docker, brew) and provides helpful error messages

3. **Flexibility**: Components work independently but integrate seamlessly through the main Distributor class

4. **Platform Support**: Properly handles platform-specific paths and requirements (Windows vs Unix, macOS for Homebrew)

5. **Testing Strategy**: Mock external dependencies in unit tests while providing real integration tests

## Usage Example

```python
from chunker.distribution import Distributor

# Initialize distributor
dist = Distributor()

# Prepare a release
success, info = dist.prepare_release("1.0.0", "Initial stable release")

# Build and publish
if success:
    # Create artifacts
    artifacts = dist.create_release_artifacts("1.0.0", Path("dist"))
    
    # Publish to PyPI
    success, info = dist.publish_to_pypi(Path("dist"), dry_run=True)
    
    # Build Docker image
    success, image_id = dist.build_docker_image("chunker:1.0.0")
    
    # Generate Homebrew formula
    success, formula = dist.create_homebrew_formula("1.0.0", Path("homebrew"))
```

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/distribution.md` covering:
- Component overview
- Usage examples
- Configuration requirements
- Error handling patterns
- Best practices

## Future Enhancements

While the implementation is complete and functional, potential future enhancements could include:
- GPG signing for release artifacts
- Automated changelog generation from git commits
- Support for additional package managers (npm, cargo, etc.)
- Integration with CI/CD systems
- Automated platform testing in containers

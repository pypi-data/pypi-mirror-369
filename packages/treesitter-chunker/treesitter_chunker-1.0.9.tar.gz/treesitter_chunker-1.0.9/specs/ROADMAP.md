## Historical Development Notes

This project was developed using parallel git worktrees for Phases 1-12, enabling concurrent development of multiple features. With Phases 1-12 now complete, the worktree strategy is no longer needed. Future development (Phase 13) can proceed in the main branch.

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Essential for MVP)
   - Phase 1.1: Parser Module Redesign ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**
   - Phase 2.1: Language Configuration Framework ✅ **COMPLETED** (Unblocked 5 language modules)
   - Phase 2.2: Language-Specific Implementations (Can parallelize after 2.1)
   - Phase 3.1: Context-Aware Chunking (Requires at least one language module)

2. **Medium Priority** (Enhanced functionality) - **Can Start Immediately in Parallel**
   - Phase 1.2: Plugin Architecture (Independent)
   - Phase 5.1: Advanced CLI Features (Independent)
   - Phase 5.2: Export Formats - 4 parallel tracks:
     - JSON/JSONL Export (Independent)
     - Parquet Export (Independent)
     - Graph Formats (Independent)
     - Database Export (Independent)
   - Phase 5.3: User Experience (Part of CLI enhancements)

3. **Low Priority** (Nice to have) - **Can Start Immediately**
   - Phase 4.1-4.2: Performance & Scalability (Independent)
   - Phase 6.2: Documentation (Independent)
   - Phase 3.2-3.3: Semantic Understanding (After language modules)

**Parallelization Summary**:
- **6 features can start immediately**: Plugin Architecture, CLI, JSON Export, Performance, Documentation
- **5 language modules can start after Phase 2.1**: Python, Rust, JavaScript, C, C++
- **Total potential parallel tracks**: 12 independent work streams

**Current Status**: Phase 1.1 is fully implemented, tested with 78 passing tests, and production-ready. The critical path is Phase 2.1 (Language Configuration Framework) which blocks 5 language modules. All other features can proceed in parallel immediately.

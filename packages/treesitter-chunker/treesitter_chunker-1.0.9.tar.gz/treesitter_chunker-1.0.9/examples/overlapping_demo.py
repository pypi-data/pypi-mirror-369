## Introduction

This is a comprehensive guide to our project. The documentation covers all aspects
of the system architecture, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:
- API Gateway: Handles all incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services
- Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and authorization
- Data Processing Service: Handles all data transformation and analysis
- Storage Service: Manages data persistence and retrieval

## Implementation Details

### API Gateway

The API Gateway is implemented using Node.js and Express. It provides:
1. Request routing based on URL patterns
2. Load balancing across service instances
3. Request/response transformation
4. Rate limiting and throttling

### Authentication Service

Built with Python and FastAPI, this service handles:
- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control
- Password reset functionality

## Usage Instructions

To get started with the system:
1. Install all dependencies using the provided scripts
2. Configure environment variables as described in .env.example
3. Run the initialization script to set up the database
4. Start all services using docker-compose

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:
- Connection refused: Check if all services are running
- Authentication failed: Verify JWT token is valid
- Data not persisting: Check database connection settings

## Overview

This document describes the configuration options available in our system.

## Basic Settings

### Server Configuration

```yaml
server:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  workers: 4
```

### Database Configuration

```yaml
database:
  host: db.example.com
  port: 5432
  name: myapp
  user: appuser
```

## Advanced Settings

For production deployments, consider these additional settings:

### Performance Tuning

Connection pooling can significantly improve performance:

```yaml
pool:
  min_connections: 10
  max_connections: 100
  idle_timeout: 300
```

### Security Settings

Always enable these in production:

```yaml
security:
  ssl_enabled: true
  cert_path: /etc/ssl/certs/app.crt
  key_path: /etc/ssl/private/app.key
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables override config file settings:

- APP_HOST: Override server.host
- APP_PORT: Override server.port
- DB_HOST: Override database.host
- DB_PASSWORD: Database password (never store in config file)

## Troubleshooting

If settings don't take effect:

1. Check environment variables first
2. Verify config file syntax
3. Look for typos in setting names
4. Restart the application

Remember that changes require a full restart.

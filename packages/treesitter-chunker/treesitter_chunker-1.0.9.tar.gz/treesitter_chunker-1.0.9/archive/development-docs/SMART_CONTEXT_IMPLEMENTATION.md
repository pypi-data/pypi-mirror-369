# Smart Context Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the smart-context feature for Tree-sitter chunker Phase 8, providing AST-based context extraction to preserve semantic meaning when creating code chunks.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Interfaces (chunker/interfaces/context.py)
- **ContextExtractor**: Extract imports, type definitions, dependencies, and parent context from AST
- **SymbolResolver**: Find symbol definitions and references in the AST
- **ScopeAnalyzer**: Analyze scope relationships and visible symbols
- **ContextFilter**: Filter context items for relevance to chunks
- **ContextItem**: Data class representing a single context item with type, content, and importance

### 2. Base Implementations (chunker/context/)
- **BaseContextExtractor**: Common functionality for extracting various context types
- **BaseSymbolResolver**: Foundation for symbol resolution with caching
- **BaseScopeAnalyzer**: Scope analysis with scope chain tracking
- **BaseContextFilter**: Relevance scoring based on AST distance and references
- **ContextFactory**: Factory for creating language-specific implementations

### 3. Language-Specific Implementations

#### Python (chunker/context/languages/python.py)
- Extracts imports, classes, functions, and decorators
- Handles nested scopes and comprehensions
- Recognizes Python-specific constructs like type annotations

#### JavaScript (chunker/context/languages/javascript.py)
- Extracts ES6 imports, classes, and arrow functions
- Handles React components and JSX
- Recognizes const/let/var declarations and closures

### 4. Context Building
- Prioritizes context items by importance (imports > type definitions > dependencies)
- Groups context by type for better organization
- Supports size limitations with graceful truncation
- Builds self-contained context prefixes for chunks

## Key Features

1. **Import Extraction**: Automatically identifies and includes necessary import statements
2. **Type Definition Extraction**: Captures class and interface declarations (truncated to signatures)
3. **Parent Context**: Includes enclosing scopes (classes, functions) for nested code
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Finds references within chunks and includes their definitions
5. **Relevance Filtering**: Scores context items based on AST distance and actual usage
6. **Language-Specific Support**: Tailored extractors for Python and JavaScript with extensible design

## Testing

### Unit Tests (tests/unit/context/)
- Test each component in isolation
- Verify base functionality and language-specific implementations
- Cover edge cases like caching, floating-point comparisons, and empty contexts

### Integration Tests (tests/integration/context/)
- Test full workflow with real code examples
- Verify context extraction for complex scenarios (nested functions, React components)
- Ensure context helps create self-contained chunks

## Usage Example

```python
from chunker.context import ContextFactory
from chunker.parser import get_parser

# Parse code
parser = get_parser('python')
tree = parser.parse(code.encode())

# Create context components
extractor, resolver, analyzer, filter = ContextFactory.create_all('python')

# Extract context for a specific node
imports = extractor.extract_imports(tree.root_node, code.encode())
type_defs = extractor.extract_type_definitions(tree.root_node, code.encode())
parent_context = extractor.extract_parent_context(target_node, tree.root_node, code.encode())

# Filter and build context
all_context = imports + type_defs + parent_context
relevant_context = [item for item in all_context if filter.is_relevant(item, target_node)]
context_prefix = extractor.build_context_prefix(relevant_context)

# Create self-contained chunk
enhanced_chunk = context_prefix + "\n\n" + chunk_content
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Deep Type Analysis**: Track variable types through assignments to better identify dependencies
2. **Cross-File Context**: Support importing context from other files in the project
3. **More Languages**: Add support for TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.
4. **Semantic Relevance**: Use more sophisticated analysis to determine which context is truly needed
5. **Context Compression**: Minimize context size while maintaining semantic completeness

## Test Results

All 70 tests passing:
- 53 unit tests covering individual components
- 17 integration tests verifying end-to-end functionality
- Comprehensive coverage of Python and JavaScript context extraction

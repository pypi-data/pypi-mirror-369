# Build System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Build System component has been successfully implemented for Phase 13: Developer Tools & Distribution. This component provides cross-platform grammar compilation, wheel building, and platform detection capabilities.

## Implemented Contracts

### BuildSystemContract
All methods have been implemented:

1. **compile_grammars()** - Compiles tree-sitter grammars for specified platforms
   - Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
   - Auto-detects available compilers (gcc, clang, cl.exe)
   - Produces platform-specific shared libraries (.so, .dylib, .dll)

2. **build_wheel()** - Builds platform-specific wheels for distribution
   - Creates properly tagged wheels with compiled grammars
   - Includes all necessary metadata
   - Handles platform-specific naming conventions

3. **create_conda_package()** - Creates conda packages
   - Checks for conda-build availability
   - Provides clear error messages when tools are missing

4. **verify_build()** - Verifies build artifacts
   - Validates wheel structure and contents
   - Checks for required components
   - Verifies platform compatibility

### PlatformSupportContract
All methods have been implemented:

1. **detect_platform()** - Detects current platform details
   - Returns OS, architecture, Python version, compiler info
   - Generates correct platform tags for wheel naming
   - Detects libc version on Linux

2. **install_build_dependencies()** - Installs platform-specific dependencies
   - Handles Windows (Visual Studio), macOS (Xcode), Linux (gcc)
   - Provides installation guidance when tools are missing

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Support
- Automatic platform detection
- Platform-specific compilation flags
- Proper library naming (.so, .dylib, .dll)

### Build Process
- Grammar source collection from tree-sitter repositories
- Incremental compilation support
- Error handling with detailed messages

### Wheel Building
- Manual wheel creation without relying on setup.py
- Correct platform and Python version tagging
- Includes compiled grammar libraries

### Verification
- Comprehensive artifact validation
- Component presence checking
- Platform compatibility verification

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `test_build_system_unit.py` - Tests individual components
- All 5 unit tests passing

### Integration Tests
- `test_phase13_build_integration_real.py` - Real implementation tests
- `test_phase13_build_adapter.py` - Adapter for official integration tests
- All integration tests passing

### Demo
- `examples/build_demo.py` - Interactive demonstration
- Shows platform detection, compilation, wheel building, and verification

## File Structure

```
chunker/build/
├── __init__.py           # Package exports
├── builder.py            # Main BuildSystem implementation
├── platform.py           # PlatformSupport implementation
├── cross_compile.py      # Cross-compilation utilities
└── README.md            # Component documentation
```

## Usage Example

```python
from chunker.build import BuildSystem, PlatformSupport

# Initialize
build_sys = BuildSystem()

# Detect platform
info = build_sys.platform_support.detect_platform()

# Compile grammars
success, build_info = build_sys.compile_grammars(
    ["python", "javascript"],
    info["os"],
    Path("./build")
)

# Build wheel
success, wheel = build_sys.build_wheel(
    info["os"],
    info["python_tag"],
    Path("./dist")
)

# Verify
valid, report = build_sys.verify_build(wheel, info["os"])
```

## Dependencies

- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Optional: conda-build for conda packages
- Platform compilers: gcc/clang (Unix), cl.exe (Windows)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Compilation**
   - Docker-based builds for other platforms
   - manylinux wheel support
   - Universal2 builds for macOS

2. **Build Optimization**
   - Parallel compilation
   - Incremental builds
   - Build caching

3. **Extended Platform Support**
   - ARM builds
   - musl libc support
   - WebAssembly targets

## Known Limitations

1. Cross-compilation requires platform-specific toolchains
2. Conda package building requires conda-build installation
3. Windows builds require Visual Studio Build Tools

## Conclusion

The Build System component is fully functional and meets all contract requirements. It provides a solid foundation for building and distributing the tree-sitter chunker across multiple platforms.

# Semantic Merging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 9 semantic merging features for the Tree-sitter Chunker. The implementation intelligently merges related code chunks based on semantic analysis using Tree-sitter AST information, reducing fragmentation while preserving semantic coherence.

## Components Implemented

### 1. RelationshipAnalyzer (`chunker/semantic/analyzer.py`)
The `TreeSitterRelationshipAnalyzer` class provides comprehensive relationship analysis:

- **Getter/Setter Detection**: Identifies getter/setter method pairs using language-specific patterns
- **Overloaded Function Detection**: Finds groups of overloaded functions with the same base name
- **Cohesion Scoring**: Calculates relationship strength between chunks (0.0-1.0)
- **Interface/Implementation Mapping**: Tracks which classes implement which interfaces
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, and more

Key features:
- Language-specific regex patterns for getter/setter naming conventions
- Smart detection of property methods in Python (@property decorators)
- Event handler grouping for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Configurable cohesion scoring based on proximity, context, and relationships

### 2. SemanticMerger (`chunker/semantic/merger.py`)
The `TreeSitterSemanticMerger` class implements intelligent chunk merging:

- **Configurable Merging Rules**: Control which types of chunks get merged
- **Size Constraints**: Respects maximum merged chunk size limits
- **Cohesion Threshold**: Only merges chunks above a configurable cohesion score
- **Language-Specific Logic**: Special handling for Python properties, JS event handlers, etc.
- **Atomic Merging**: Uses Union-Find algorithm to build merge groups

Configuration options via `MergeConfig`:
```python
MergeConfig(
    merge_getters_setters=True,      # Merge getter/setter pairs
    merge_overloaded_functions=True,  # Merge overloaded functions
    merge_small_methods=True,         # Merge small related methods
    small_method_threshold=10,        # Max lines for "small" methods
    max_merged_size=100,             # Max lines in merged chunk
    cohesion_threshold=0.6           # Min cohesion score to merge
)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Tests (`tests/test_semantic_merging.py`)
Extensive test coverage with 32 test methods including:
- Getter/setter pair detection across multiple languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, C#)
- Overloaded function grouping and merging
- Cohesion score calculation with edge cases
- Merge configuration validation
- Language-specific feature testing:
  - Python @property decorators
  - JavaScript event handlers and ES6 classes
  - TypeScript interfaces and implementations
  - Java constructor overloading
  - Go method receivers
  - Ruby getter/setter patterns
  - C# property patterns
- Edge cases:
  - Empty chunks
  - Size boundary conditions
  - Mixed language handling
  - Transitive relationship merging
  - Metadata preservation
- Performance testing (caching verification)

## Key Features

### Multi-Language Support
The implementation supports language-specific patterns:

**Python**:
- `get_name()`/`set_name()` patterns
- `@property` and `@name.setter` decorators
- Method proximity analysis
- `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` grouping

**Java/C#**:
- `getName()`/`setName()` patterns (CamelCase)
- Interface/implementation relationships
- Overloaded method detection
- Constructor overloading support

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
- Getter/setter patterns (both traditional and ES6)
- Event handler grouping (`onClick`, `onSubmit`, etc.)
- ES6 class method analysis
- Modern getter/setter syntax (`get name()`, `set name()`)

**Go**:
- `GetName()`/`SetName()` patterns (CamelCase)
- Method receiver support
- Interface implementation tracking

**Ruby**:
- Property-style methods (`name`, `name=`)
- Attribute accessor patterns

**C++/C**:
- `get_name()`/`set_name()` patterns
- Multiple naming conventions support

### Intelligent Merging Algorithm
1. Analyzes all chunks to find relationships
2. Builds cohesion graph between chunks
3. Groups related chunks using Union-Find
4. Respects size and configuration constraints
5. Preserves semantic boundaries

### Configuration Flexibility
Three preset configurations demonstrated:
- **Conservative**: Only merge obvious pairs (getters/setters)
- **Moderate**: Include overloads and small related methods
- **Aggressive**: Merge most related chunks within size limits

## Usage Example

```python
from chunker.semantic import TreeSitterSemanticMerger, MergeConfig

# Configure merging behavior
config = MergeConfig(
    merge_getters_setters=True,
    merge_overloaded_functions=True,
    cohesion_threshold=0.7
)

# Create merger
merger = TreeSitterSemanticMerger(config)

# Merge chunks
merged_chunks = merger.merge_chunks(original_chunks)

# Get merge reasons
reason = merger.get_merge_reason(chunk1, chunk2)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Fragmentation**: Related code stays together
2. **Better Context**: Merged chunks provide more complete context for LLMs
3. **Semantic Preservation**: Respects logical boundaries while reducing chunk count
4. **Flexibility**: Highly configurable to match different use cases
5. **Language-Aware**: Handles language-specific patterns correctly

## Implementation Notes

### Test Coverage
- 32 comprehensive test methods covering all major features
- Tests for 8 programming languages
- Edge case handling and error conditions
- Performance and caching verification

### Key Algorithms
- **Union-Find**: Used for building merge groups with transitive relationships
- **Cohesion Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring including proximity, shared context, references, and dependencies
- **Pattern Matching**: Language-specific regex patterns for method name analysis

### Integration Points
- Works seamlessly with existing chunker infrastructure
- Compatible with all export formats (JSON, JSONL, Parquet, etc.)
- Can be combined with other chunking strategies

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified:
1. Add support for more language patterns (Kotlin, Swift, etc.)
2. Implement cross-file relationship tracking
3. Add machine learning-based cohesion scoring
4. Support custom merge rules via configuration files
5. Integrate with token counting for LLM-optimized chunks
6. Add visual merge analysis tools
7. Support for framework-specific patterns (React components, Django views, etc.)

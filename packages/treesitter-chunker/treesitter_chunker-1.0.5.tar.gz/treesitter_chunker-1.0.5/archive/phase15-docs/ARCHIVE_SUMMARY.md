# Phase 15 Documentation Archive

This directory contains implementation-specific documentation from Phase 15 that was moved from the main docs directory. These documents describe internal implementation details rather than user-facing features.

## Archived Files

### cicd_component.md
- **Purpose**: Documented the internal implementation of the CI/CD Pipeline component
- **Reason for archiving**: Implementation details specific to Phase 15 development
- **User documentation**: CI/CD features are documented in the main README and user guide

### distribution_component.md
- **Purpose**: Documented the internal implementation of the Distribution component
- **Reason for archiving**: Implementation details specific to Phase 15 development
- **User documentation**: Distribution features are documented in packaging.md and the main README

## Files Kept in Main Docs

All other files in the docs directory were kept because they provide:
- User-facing documentation (installation, configuration, usage guides)
- API references (api-reference.md, plugin-development.md)
- Feature documentation (metadata-extraction.md, overlapping-fallback.md, etc.)
- Architecture overviews (architecture.md)
- Lessons learned from the entire project (LESSONS_LEARNED.md)

## Archive Date
- Date: 2025-07-25
- Phase: Post Phase 15 completion
- Reason: Documentation cleanup to focus on user-facing content

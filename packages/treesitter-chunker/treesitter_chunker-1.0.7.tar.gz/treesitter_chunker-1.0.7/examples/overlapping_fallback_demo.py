## Introduction

This project demonstrates the overlapping fallback chunker.
It's designed for files without Tree-sitter support.

## Features

- Configurable overlap strategies
- Support for line and character-based chunking
- Natural boundary detection
- Clear warnings when used

## Usage

The chunker can be used programmatically:

```python
chunker = OverlappingFallbackChunker()
chunks = chunker.chunk_with_overlap(content, path)
```

## Configuration

You can configure overlap size and strategy.

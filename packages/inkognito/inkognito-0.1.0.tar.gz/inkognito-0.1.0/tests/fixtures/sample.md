# Technical Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides technical specifications for our software system. It contains no personally identifiable information and serves as a test fixture for document processing.

## System Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following key components:

- API Gateway: Handles request routing and authentication
- Service Registry: Maintains service discovery information
- Message Queue: Enables asynchronous communication
- Database Layer: Provides data persistence

### Core Services

1. **Authentication Service**
   - JWT token generation
   - User validation
   - Session management

2. **Processing Service**
   - Document parsing
   - Data transformation
   - Result caching

3. **Storage Service**
   - File management
   - Metadata indexing
   - Backup operations

## Configuration

System configuration uses environment variables:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  timeout: 30s

database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  name: appdb

cache:
  ttl: 3600
  max_size: 1000
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| /api/v1/status | GET | Health check |
| /api/v1/process | POST | Process document |
| /api/v1/result/{id} | GET | Get result |

## Performance Metrics

Current system performance benchmarks:

- Request latency: < 100ms (p95)
- Throughput: 1000 req/s
- Error rate: < 0.1%
- Uptime: 99.9%

## Deployment

The application supports multiple deployment strategies:

### Container Deployment

```bash
docker build -t app:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 app:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
```

## Monitoring

System monitoring includes:

- Application logs (structured JSON)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Error tracking (Sentry)

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture and operational procedures. For additional details, consult the API reference guide.

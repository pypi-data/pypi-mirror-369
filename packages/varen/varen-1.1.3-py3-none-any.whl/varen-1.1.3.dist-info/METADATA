# 🐎 VAREN: Very Accurate and Realistic Equine Network

[ [Project Page](https://varen.is.tue.mpg.de/) ][ [Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zuffi_VAREN_Very_Accurate_and_Realistic_Equine_Network_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) ][ [Training Code](https://github.com/silviazuffi/varen) ]

This respository contains a user-friendly, light-weight implementation - similar to [SMPLX](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx/) - of VAREN from on the paper: *VAREN: Very Accurate and Realistic Equine Network* by Silvia Zuffi, Ylva Mellbin, Ci Li, Markus Hoeschle, Hedvig Kjellström, Senya Polikovsky, Elin Hernlund, and Michael J. Black, CVPR 2024.


For the original code base, including the training methods, please see the [training code](https://github.com/silviazuffi/varen).

## TO DOS:
- [ ] Extend/ the Vertex Selector for each model. Currently missing are the Hooves.  
- [x] Remove Chumpy dependency (original optimisation was done with Chumpy)
- [x] Add more documentation

## Description

*VAREN* is a equine body model with shape parameters trained on real horses. *VAREN* uses standard vertex based linear blend skinning with learned corrective blend
shapes, has N = 13,873 vertices and K = 38 joints,
which include joints for the neck, jaw, ears and tail and hooves. 
VAREN is defined by a function M(θ, β), where θ is the pose parameters, β the shape parameters.

## News
- 🔥 27 February 2025: Package available on pip!
- ⚡ 16 January 2025: This repo goes live.

## Installation

You have two options for installing the model:
1. Just interested in embedding the model in your codebase/method
2. Installing this exact repo with tools and visualisations etc

Most people will be interested only in option 1.

### Installing the model only

The easiest way to install the model, is via pip:

```Shell
pip install varen
```


Note: Minor updates will be published here on github first:
pip install git+https://github.com/TheDepe/VAREN.git




### Installing the model along with this repo
This repository provides some basic scripts and tools to get an idea of how to use VAREN. To install the model please follow the next steps in the specified order:

Clone this repository and install it using the *pyproject.toml* backend: 
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/TheDepe/VAREN.git
cd VAREN
pip install -e .[all] 
```


## Downloading the model

To download the *VAREN* model:
Go to [this project website](https://varen.is.tue.mpg.de/) and register to get access to the downloads section. 
- Download the `VAREN.pkl` Pickle file.
- Download the Checkpoint `varen.pth` file.


Place each of these in a directory as follows. Note, you must specify the path to the when loading the model:

```
varen
   └── VAREN.pkl
   └── varen.pth
```



## Model loading
When loading the model, you must specify the path to the directory containing these models eg:

```
from varen import VAREN
varen = VAREN("/a/b/c/varen")
```

The model will load the necessary files itself. 


## Example

After installing the *VAREN* package and downloading the model parameters you should be able to run the `visualise_model.py` script to visualise the results. For this step you have to install the [trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) package (installed directly via `pip install -e .[all]`. Will need to install separately if installed directly from this repository).

You can run the script via:

```
python examples/visualise_model.py --model_path /path/to/downloaded/models
```
Optionally, you can save the meshes as follows:
```
python examples/visualise_model.py --model_path /path/to/downloaded/models --output_path /path/to/save/meshes --save-meshes
```

## Using the model

Usage of the model is similar to that of [smplx](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx/). VAREN (or HSMAL/SMAL) can be intialised as follows:
```
varen = VAREN(model_path)
``` 
or optionally without neural muscle deformations:
```
varen = VAREN(model_path, use_muscle_deformations=False)
```

A forward pass can be called simply by (with or without arguments):
```
output = varen(body_pose=pose, betas=shape)
```

Output elements can be accessed via (e.g):
```
output.vertices
output.global_orient
output.body_pose
output.body_betas
output.muscle_betas
```

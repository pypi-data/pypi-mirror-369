    ``store`` keeps ``{"w": int, "f": int, "s": float}`` per band.  For
    each surviving band ``w`` and ``f`` are incremented and ``s`` gains the
    band's current weight.  Pruned bands have all three metrics decremented by
    one and clamped to zero, modelling negative reinforcement.

    allowing operation on metric dictionaries produced by upstream modules.

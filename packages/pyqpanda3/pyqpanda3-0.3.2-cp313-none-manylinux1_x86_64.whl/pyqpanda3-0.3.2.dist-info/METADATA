# How to use pyqpanda3

**pyqpanda3** is a high-performance Python quantum programming library built on the QPanda3 core and wrapped with pybind11.  
It exposes QPanda3's core functionalities seamlessly through Python interfaces, enabling developers to enjoy the simplicity and flexibility of Python while maintaining the high-efficiency execution performance of the C++ core.  

Thanks to the zero-overhead binding mechanism of pybind11, pyqpanda3 incurs almost no performance loss when invoking quantum circuit compilation, simulation, and cloud execution in Python.  
This design also lowers the learning curve and reduces the barrier to entry.  

pyqpanda3 fully inherits QPanda3's optimized compiler, hardware-aware mapping, quantum simulators, and cloud computing service interfaces, supporting end-to-end development from local simulation to execution on real quantum hardware.  
Its modular architecture and unified API design allow users to implement complex quantum algorithms with less code, achieving both research efficiency and engineering performance.

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

*Scoring Matrices* are matrices used to score the matches and mismatches between
two characters are the same position in a sequence alignment. Some of these
matrices are derived from *substitution matrices*, which uses evolutionary 
modeling.

The `scoring-matrices` package is a dependency-free, batteries included library
to handle and distribute common substitution matrices:

- **no external dependencies**: The matrices are distributed as-is: you don't 
  need the whole [Biopython](https://biopython.org) ecosystem, or even 
  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
- **Cython compatibility**: The `ScoringMatrix` is a Cython class that can be
  inherited, and the matrix data can be accessed as either a raw pointer, or
  a [typed memoryview](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html).
- **most common matrices**: The package distributes most common matrices, such as 
  those used by the NCBI BLAST+ suite, including:
  - [*PAM*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_accepted_mutation#) matrices by Dayhoff *et al.* (1978).
  - [*BLOSUM*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLOSUM) matrices by Henikoff & Henikoff (1992).
  - *VTML* matrices by Muller *et al.* (2002).
  - *BENNER* matrices by Benner *et al.* (1994).

## üîß Installing

`scoring-matrices` can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scoring-matrices/),
which hosts some pre-built wheels for the x86-64 architecture (Linux/OSX/Windows)
and the Aarch64 architecture (Linux/OSX), as well as the code required to
compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install scoring-matrices
```

Otherwise, `scoring-matrices` is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install bioconda::scoring-matrices
```

## üí° Usage

### Python

- Import the `ScoringMatrix` class from the installed module:
  ```python
  from scoring_matrices import ScoringMatrix
  ```
- Load one of the built-in matrices:
  ```python
  blosum62 = ScoringMatrix.from_name("BLOSUM62")
  ```
- Get individual matrix weights either by index or by alphabet letter:
  ```python
  x = blosum62[0, 0]
  y = blosum62['A', 'A']
  ```
- Get a row of the matrix either by index or by alphabet letter:
  ```python
  row_x = blosum62[0]
  row_y = blosum62['A']
  ```

### Cython

- Access the matrix weights as raw pointers to constant data:
  ```cython
  from scoring_matrices cimport ScoringMatrix

  cdef ScoringMatrix blosum = ScoringMatrix.from_name("BLOSUM62")
  cdef const float*  data   = blosum.data_ptr()    # dense array
  cdef const float** matrix = blosum.matrix_ptr()  # array of pointers
  ```
- Access the `ScoringMatrix` weights as a [typed memoryview](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html) 
  using the *buffer protocol* in more recents versions of Python:
  ```cython
  from scoring_matrices cimport ScoringMatrix

  cdef ScoringMatrix     blosum  = ScoringMatrix.from_name("BLOSUM62")
  cdef const float[:, :] weights = blosum
  ```

# SenseTable


![SenseTable](http://stcdn.smoosense.ai/SenseTable-light.svg)


SenseTable is a purpose-built tool that turns repeititive and manual work in ML data exploration into a smooth intuitive flow-experience. Unlike traditional analytics tools, it’s designed for the ambiguous, branching questions that crop up at every stage of the ML lifecycle—from checking raw data quality and uncovering outliers to investigating model failures and monitoring drift. SenseTable automates 80% of repetitive tasks, works seamlessly with formats like CSV, Parquet, JSONL, and Lance, whether stored locally or in the cloud, and offers a flexible, IDE-style interface with powerful visualization, drill-through, and large-scale data handling.

SenseTable empowers you spend less time writing ad-hoc scripts and more time in flow, finding the insights that matter.

## Quick start
For prerequisites, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (an extremely fast Python package manager):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
Start a new terminal after you just installed `uv`. Then install or update SenseTable CLI:
```bash
uv tool install -U sense-table
```

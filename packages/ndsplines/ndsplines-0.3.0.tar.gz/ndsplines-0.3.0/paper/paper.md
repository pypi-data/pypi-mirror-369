# Summary

In order to use data driven models in analysis, the data must be projected onto a set of basis functions to allow the model to be evaluated over a continuous domain. Additionally, the known form of the basis functions enables the use of calculus and other symbolic operations to be performed on the representation of the data model.

B-Splines are a particularly useful basis because they have beneficial analytic properties and because many efficient algorithms for their creation, manipulation, and evaluation have already been developed [@de1978practical]. Some of the beneficial properties of the B-Spline basis functions include: a closed support, smoothness, and amenability to efficient and stable algorithms. Strictly speaking, the B-Spline basis functions are 1-dimensional maps from the reals to the reals. However, they can be readily extended to N-dimensions by taking tensor products of B-Splines on orthogonal 1-dimensional spaces for each variable. 

B-Splines are well studied in the field of computer graphics where they are particularly used in computer aided-design (CAD) and graphic design programs. Due to this popularity, many programming language ecosystems have implementations of 1- and 2-dimensional splines such as might be used to design curves or surfaces. For example, SciPy provides a number of interfaces to Dierckx's FORTRAN implementation as well as a custom 1-D implementation [@scipy; @dierckx1995curve]. However, the authors are only aware of one general N-dimensional splines implementation [@de1990spline].

ndsplines is a Python package for multivariate B-splines with performant NumPy and C (via Cython) implementations [@van2011numpy; @behnel2011cython]. A primary goal of this package is to provide a unified API for tensor product splines of arbitrary input and output dimension. This implementation is slightly slower than the special-case 1-D and 2-D implementations available from SciPy, but this can be a worthwhile trade-off to only use one API to work with splines of any dimension. Test coverage is about 90%, and importantly verifies desirable mathematical properties including that the spline evaluation matches other implementations, that the fundamental theorem of calculus holds for any `NDSpline` object, that the accuracy of splines produced by `make_lsq_spline` improves with the signal-to-noise ratio of the sampled data, and that the splines produced by `make_interp_spline` actually interpolate the data.

A general N-dimensional spline implementation is useful for modeling dynamics from data. For example, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) has proposed a simulation description mark-up language standard [@daveml]. One of the fundamental elements of the mark-up language is an interpolator of aerodynamic data, which often uses three to five independent variables to capture properties of the airflow and orientation.

One author has used a precursor to this software package along with SimuPy [@margolis2017simupy] to simulate hypersonic entry dynamics in a manner similar to what was described in AIAAâ€™s simulation description mark-up language [@d2019developing; @margolis2019control]. Static stability analysis was also performed using this software package.

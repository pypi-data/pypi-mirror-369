"""Tool system for agent capabilities.

This module provides the tool system that enables agents to interact with external
systems and perform actions. It includes:

- Tool: Base class for creating custom tools
- Built-in tools: Files, Retrieve, Scrape, Search, Shell
- @tool: Decorator for registering tool functions

Example:
    Using built-in tools:

    ```python
    from cogency import Agent
    from cogency.tools import Files, Retrieve

    agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[Files(), Retrieve()])
    ```

    Creating custom tools:

    ```python
    from cogency.tools import tool

    @tool
    def calculator(expression: str) -> float:
        '''Simple calculator tool.'''
        return eval(expression)
    ```

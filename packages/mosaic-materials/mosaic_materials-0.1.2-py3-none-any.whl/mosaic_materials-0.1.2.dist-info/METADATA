## MOSAIC-materials
#### Monte-Carlo optimisation with scattering and interatomic-potential constraints for materials.

`mosaic-materials` provides a Monte Carlo engine for the optimisation of 
material structures with scattering and interatomic-potential constraints.


## Quickstart

```bash
pip install mosaic-materials
```

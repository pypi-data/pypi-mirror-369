# Subject Researcher MCP - Iterative Target-Driven Research Enhancements

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. Iterative Loop Control with Quality Meters ‚úÖ
- **QualityMeters class**: Tracks coverage, recency, novelty, agreement, contradictions
- **IterationState class**: Manages iteration state, stagnation detection, widening factor
- **Stop Criteria**: Configurable gates for when to stop research based on quality metrics
- **Automatic Continuation Logic**: Research continues until quality gates are satisfied

### 2. Stop Criteria and Widening Logic ‚úÖ  
- **Stagnation Detection**: Monitors novelty drops below threshold
- **Automatic Widening**: Increases search scope when stagnation detected
- **Configurable Thresholds**: min_coverage, min_recency, novelty_threshold, max_contradictions
- **Iteration Limits**: Prevents infinite loops with max_iterations constraint

### 3. Multi-Vertical Search Beyond DuckDuckGo ‚úÖ
- **Search Verticals**: Web, News, Docs, Community, Academic
- **Progressive Expansion**: Later iterations include more verticals
- **Filtered Results**: Each vertical filters for relevant content types
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate URLs across iterations

**Implemented Search Methods:**
- `_search_news()`: News sources with recent modifiers
- `_search_docs()`: Documentation, tutorials, guides with domain filtering
- `_search_community()`: Forums, discussions (Reddit, StackOverflow, etc.)
- `_search_academic()`: Scholarly sources with academic indicators

### 4. Sophisticated Atomic Claim Mining ‚úÖ
- **Atomic Claim Extraction**: Breaks content into falsifiable, standalone claims
- **Enhanced Claim Detection**: Factual vs opinion indicators with confidence modifiers
- **Metadata Extraction**: Units, measurements, caveats automatically extracted
- **Independence Detection**: Cross-source validation and duplicate detection

**Key Features:**
- Confidence modifiers for quantitative vs opinion statements
- Automatic extraction of units (%, times, x faster, etc.)
- Caveat detection (however, but, although, except, etc.)
- Cross-validation boosts for claims found in multiple independent sources

### 5. Enhanced Credibility Scoring with Independence Matrix ‚úÖ
- **Independence Matrix**: Calculates independence scores between all source pairs
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Domain authority, recency, content quality, independence, claim validation
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Stores credibility factors for transparency
- **Related Domain Detection**: Identifies same organization sources

**Credibility Factors:**
- Domain Authority (Wikipedia: 0.9, Nature: 0.95, arXiv: 0.8, etc.)
- Recency Bonus (30 days: +0.2, 180 days: +0.1, etc.)
- Content Quality (length, depth indicators)
- Independence Factor (average independence from other sources)
- Claim Validation (claims supported by other sources)

### 6. Answer-First Synthesis with Inline Citations ‚úÖ
- **Citation System**: Automatic numbering and inline citation insertion
- **Answer-First Structure**: Direct answer ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí detailed analysis
- **Cross-Reference Claims**: Links claims to supporting sources
- **Confidence Integration**: Uses source credibility and agreement levels

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Core Classes Enhanced:
- `QualityMeters`: Tracks 5 key metrics per iteration
- `IterationState`: Manages iteration lifecycle and stagnation
- `Source`: Added credibility_breakdown field for detailed scoring
- `Claim`: Enhanced with units, caveats, supporting_sources

### New Methods Added:
- `conduct_iterative_research()`: Main iterative research workflow
- `_phase2_adaptive_queries()`: Iteration-aware query generation
- `_phase3_harvest_iterative()`: Multi-vertical harvesting with deduplication
- `_update_quality_meters()`: Quality metrics calculation
- `_extract_atomic_claims()`: Sophisticated claim extraction
- `_detect_claim_independence()`: Cross-source independence analysis
- `_build_independence_matrix()`: Source relationship mapping
- `_calculate_credibility_factors()`: Multi-dimensional credibility scoring

### Quality Metrics Implementation:
```python
class QualityMeters:
    coverage: float = 0.0      # Topic coverage completeness
    recency: float = 0.0       # Source freshness
    novelty: float = 0.0       # New information rate
    agreement: float = 0.0     # Cross-source consistency  
    contradictions: float = 0.0 # Conflicting claims level
```

"""
ODVM - Open, Dynamic, and Versatile Modeling AutoML System
=========================================================

ODVM is a powerful and flexible Python package for automated data analysis, 
preprocessing, modeling, and reporting. Designed to handle both small-scale 
(Pandas) and large-scale (Dask) datasets, ODVM simplifies the entire 
machine learning workflow â€” from raw data to deployable models.

Key Features
------------
1. **Automated Data Profiling & EDA**  
   - Summarizes datasets with descriptive statistics, correlations, and distributions.
   - Detects missing values, outliers, and duplicate records automatically.

2. **Smart Preprocessing**  
   - Handles missing data, categorical encoding, scaling, and outlier removal.
   - Automatically adapts methods based on task type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

3. **Dynamic Task Detection**  
   - Identifies task type (e.g., binary classification, regression, time series).
   - Determines learning mode (supervised vs unsupervised).

4. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Automatically selects suitable models for the detected task type.
   - Supports multiple algorithms: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Scikit-learn models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation included.

5. **Performance Evaluation & Reporting**  
   - Generates evaluation metrics in tables and visual charts.
   - Creates HTML/PDF reports summarizing workflow results.

6. **Extensible & Modular Design**  
   - Well-structured architecture for easy customization.
   - Supports future plugins, deployment, and monitoring modules (In future).

Planned Extensions
------------------
- Support for anomaly detection.
- Integrated deployment pipelines with FastAPI.
- Real-time monitoring of deployed models.

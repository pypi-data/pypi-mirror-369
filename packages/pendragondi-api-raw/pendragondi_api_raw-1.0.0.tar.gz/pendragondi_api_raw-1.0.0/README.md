# Pendragondi.API Raw

> **Find out how much you're wasting on redundant API calls — with one decorator and one command.**

Pendragondi.API Raw is a local utility that tracks API usage patterns in your Python applications and surfaces hidden inefficiencies like:
- Repeated identical API calls
- Missed caching opportunities
- Wasteful use of expensive services
- Undetected rate-limit collisions

It runs entirely inside your application. No proxies. No agents. No cloud services. Just insight.

## 🔍 Why It Exists

Most teams don't track how they're using APIs — they just assume they're used efficiently. But they're not:

- 💸 Many orgs waste **$1000s/month** on duplicate API calls
- 🧱 These inefficiencies compound silently across teams and services
- 🤖 Observability tools are often too heavy, too late, or too expensive

Pendragondi.API Raw gives you a simple, local way to see your API usage like an engineer *and* a finance lead — in minutes.

- ❄️ Flags missed caching opportunities
- 🚦 Surfaces rate-limited behavior (HTTP 429)
- 💵 Estimates monthly savings potential
- 📝 Outputs clean, shareable Markdown or JSON reports
- 🔒 Fully local — no external tracking or data storage

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Decorate your API functions:

```python
from pendragondi_api_raw.decorator import log_api_call_decorator
import requests

@log_api_call_decorator(service="openai", cacheable=True)
def call_openai():
    return requests.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", json={"prompt": "Hello"})
```

### 2. Run your app as normal.

### 3. Generate a report:

```bash
python -m pendragondi_api_raw.cli --output report.md
```

### 4. View the results:

```markdown

## 🧭 Why PendragonDI?

Pendragondi.API Raw was built to solve a problem no other tool addressed:  
How do I find out how my system is *quietly wasting money*—before it hits the billing dashboard?

This tool was written by someone who noticed the pattern, proved it, and compressed it into something that can run anywhere.

**No agents. No overhead. Just signal.**

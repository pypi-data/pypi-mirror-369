Tool for encapsulating, running, and reproducing projects with conda environments.


## Why?

Sharing your work is more than sharing your code in a script file or notebook. To make your work properly reproducible, it is necessary to include the list of required third-party dependencies, specifications for how to run your code, and
any other files that it may need.

See [8 Levels of Reproduciblity](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/8-levels-of-reproducibility) for an in-depth
discussion of the differences between "It works for me." to "I've made sure that anyone can reliably execute my work."
Conda Project is a framework that aims to help you to ensure a high degree of reproducibility in the projects you
create.

### How is this different from Anaconda Project?

This package is intended as a successor to [Anaconda Project](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-project).
We chose to create Conda Project to foster community involvement, adopt newer standards like conda-lock, and provide
a conda-native workflow. A standalone conversion script is provided in this repo at `scripts/ap-to-cp.py`. You can run
it as follows. By default it will write Conda Project files into your current working directory. You can read anaconda-project.yml file from any other directory or output Conda Project files to any other directory.

You'll need `pydantic` and `ruamel.yaml` installed.

```text
python ap-to-cp.py /path/to/anaconda-project.yml [/output/directory]
```

## Installation

You can install conda-project using the conda package manager:

```text
conda install -c conda-forge conda-project
```

## Quick start

Let's start a new project using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks.
The commands below will work on terminals in Mac, Linux, and Windows.
For Windows you can use either `cmd.exe` or Powershell.

We first create a directory and initialize a new project, which will create a new conda environment and lock the dependencies:

```text
(base) > conda project init --directory my-project python=3.9 notebook pandas
Locking dependencies for environment default on platforms osx-64, osx-arm64, linux-64, win-64: done
Project created at /Users/adefusco/Development/conda-incubator/conda-project/examples/my-project
```

The goal of Conda Project is to maintain a conda enviroment specifically for the new `my-project` directory.
You'll see that this directory contains it's own `environment.yml` file a [Conda Lock](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/) file and a `conda-project.yml`
file. You can learn more about these files in the [User Guide](https://conda-incubator.github.io/conda-project/user_guide.html)

```text
(base) > tree ./
├── conda-project.yml
├── default.conda-lock.yml
├── environment.yml
```

You can activate the environment, which will install packages locally to this project according to the lock file.
Notice that after running `conda project activate` the shell prompt switches to `(default)`, which is the name
of the local environment for this project.

```text
(base) > cd my-project
(base) > conda project activate

Downloading and Extracting Packages


Downloading and Extracting Packages

Preparing transaction: done

Executing transaction: done
environment created at /Users/adefusco/Development/conda-incubator/conda-project/examples/my-project/envs/default
## Project environment default activated in a new shell.
## Exit this shell to de-activate.
```

And in the activated environment you can launch editors or run commands. For example, since we included
the `notebook` package we can launch Jupyter Notebook from the activated environment:

```text
(default) > jupyter notebook
[I 12:23:03.632 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/adefusco/Development/conda-incubator/conda-project/examples/my-project
[I 12:23:03.632 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.5.2 is running at:

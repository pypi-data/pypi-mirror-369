## How to use

1. Add the MCP server to your MCP servers:

```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-keep-mcp": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "google-keep-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_EMAIL": "Your Google Email",
        "GOOGLE_MASTER_TOKEN": "Your Google Master Token"
      }
    }
  }
```

2. Add your credentials:

- `GOOGLE_EMAIL`: Your Google account email address
- `GOOGLE_MASTER_TOKEN`: Your Google account master token

Will you will need to create a master token (unless you have a Google Enterprise account, and can access the Google Keep API directly). Follow these steps:

- Goto https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and create an app password
- Run this docker command `docker run --rm -it breph/ha-google-home_get-token` and enter your gmail address and app password (make sure it doesn't have a space at the end)
- Obtain your master token. **Be careful with this token, it has access to everything in your Google account.**

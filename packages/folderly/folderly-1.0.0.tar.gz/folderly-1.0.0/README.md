# Folderly - Smart Desktop File Management with AI Integration 🚀

Folderly is an intelligent desktop file management system that combines powerful file operations with AI-powered assistance. It helps you organize, declutter, and manage your files across Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and other folders with natural language commands and smart automation.

## ✨ **Current Features (v1.0)**

### **🤖 AI-Powered Interface**
- **Natural language commands** - "list my desktop", "create a folder called work", "move all txt files to documents"
- **Smart function selection** - AI automatically chooses the right operation for your request
- **Beautiful formatted output** - Clean, emoji-enhanced results with full paths for operations
- **Multi-task handling** - Execute multiple operations from a single command

### **📁 Core File Operations**
- **List and explore** files/folders with advanced filtering (extension, type, date, size)
- **Create directories** - Single or multiple nested folders
- **Move files/folders** - Bulk operations with smart execution
- **Copy items** - Safe copying with conflict handling
- **Rename items** - Batch renaming operations
- **Delete safely** - Files go to recycle bin (not permanent deletion)
- **Search and filter** - By pattern, extension, file type, or modification date

### **⚡ Performance & Smart Execution**
- **Async operations** - Non-blocking file operations for better performance
- **Smart execution strategy** - Automatic parallel/sequential mode selection
- **Parallel processing** - Multiple independent operations run simultaneously
- **Sequential safety** - Dependent operations execute in order

### **🎯 Easy Configuration**
- **Flexible targeting** - Manage Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, Videos
- **OneDrive support** - Automatic detection of OneDrive folder structures
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

# ARPES-Lite

ARPES-Lite is my personal fork of the original PyARPES package. I ran into some issues when first working with the package and fixing them required that I break a significant portion of the codebase.

The main improvements to pyarpes are in automation of loading and correcting data (fermi-edge correction, k-space conversion, etc.). There are also improvements and additions to QT based interactive tools.

Because of the changes made to data loading, some work is required to port endstations plugins from pyarpes. If needed, I can easily port existing endstations or add new ones.

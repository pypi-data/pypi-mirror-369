the minimum expected date.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When salesmen set a delivery date there's nothing disallowing them to
set it before the expected date computed according to the order lead
times. That can cause great issues with deliveries schedules, as those
lead times are set to ensure that the orders are delivered on time.

Configuration
=============

If you want to view the delivery date in the top of the sale order form,
you should unarchive the ``view_order_form_commitment_date_ux`` view,
which is archived by default.

Usage
=====

To test the module:

- Go to *Sales > Orders* and create a new quotation.
- Set whatever customer and order lines.
- Go to the *Other info* tab, section *Delivery* and set a *Delivery
  date* previous to the expected date.
- A popup will raise warning about setting a delivery before the minimum
  date possible to promise the delivery.
- Additionally, a warning alert will be shown on the top side of the
  order advising the salesman to fix that issue.
- If the salesman ignores it, the delivery date will be set to the
  minimum expected date when the order gets confirmed.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Make the extended view to add the delivery date to the header of the
  form configurable with config settings.

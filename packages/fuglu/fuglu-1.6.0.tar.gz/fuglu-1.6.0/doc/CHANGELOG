-- Fuglu 1.6.0 2025-08-15 "Schabziger"
Schabziger is a very dry, brittle and sharp tasting cheese from the Glarus Alps in Switzerland.
It is low in fat and high in protein, usually used as a seasoning rather than a staple. The
slightly spicy taste is defined by the seasoning herb, a type of fenugreek. Due to the very
different flavour it is once again not everybody's favourite food, but with addiction potential.

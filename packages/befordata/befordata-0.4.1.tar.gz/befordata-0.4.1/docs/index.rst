Behavioural Force Data (BeForData)
==================================

**Data structures for handling behavioural force data**

This package provides core classes and utilities for loading, processing,
and analysing behavioural force data, such as those collected in experimental
psychology or neuroscience. It offers a structured approach to manage epochs and
records of force measurements, enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis.

BeForData is based on two :doc:`data_struct` of force data: one for the representation of
the raw time-based force measurements in the shape of a dataframe (**BeForRecord**) and
one for epoch-based representations as matrices (**BeForEpochs**).
See :doc:`usage` for a detailed usage guide.


**Features**

- Flexible loading and saving of force data in common formats (e.g., CSV, XDF).
- Efficient slicing and indexing of epochs and records for batch analysis.
- Metadata management for experimental context, including event markers and annotations.
- Utilities for preprocessing, such as filtering and baseline correction.
- Integration with scientific Python libraries (NumPy, pandas) for advanced analysis.

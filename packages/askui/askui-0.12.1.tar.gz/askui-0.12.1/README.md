# ü§ñ Enable AI to control your desktop, mobile and HMI devices

**We make Windows, MacOS, Linux,  Android an iOS accessible for AI agents by finding any element on screen.**

Key features of AskUI include:

- Support for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS device automation (Citrix supported)
- Support for single-step UI automation commands (RPA like) as well as agentic intent-based instructions
- In-background automation on Windows machines (agent can create a second session; you do not have to watch it take over mouse and keyboard)
- Flexible model use (hot swap of models) and infrastructure for reteaching of models (available on-premise)
- Secure deployment of agents in enterprise environments

</details>


### 2. Install vision-agent in your Python environment

```shell
pip install askui
```

**Note:** Requires Python version >=3.10.

### 3a. Authenticate with an **AI Model** Provider

|  | AskUI [INFO](https://hub.askui.com/) | Anthropic [INFO](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ENV Variables    | `ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID`, `ASKUI_TOKEN`   | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   |
| Supported Commands    | `act()`, `click()`, `get()`, `locate()`, `mouse_move()`   | `act()`, `click()`, `get()`, `locate()`, `mouse_move()`  |
| Description    | Faster Inference, European Server, Enterprise Ready   | Supports complex actions   |

To get started, set the environment variables required to authenticate with your chosen model provider.

#### How to set an environment variable?
<details>
  <summary>Linux & MacOS</summary>

  Use export to set an evironment variable:

  ```shell
  export ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID=<your-workspace-id-here>
  export ASKUI_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Windows PowerShell</summary>

  Set an environment variable with $env:

  ```shell
  $env:ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID="<your-workspace-id-here>"
  $env:ASKUI_TOKEN="<your-token-here>"
  $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-api-key-here>"
  ```
</details>


**Example Code:**
```python
from askui import VisionAgent

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # AskUI used as default model

    agent.click("search field")

    # Use Anthropic (Claude 4 Sonnet) as model
    agent.click("search field", model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
```


### 3b. Test with ü§ó Hugging Face **AI Models** (Spaces API)

You can test the Vision Agent with Huggingface models via their Spaces API. Please note that the API is rate-limited so for production use cases, it is recommended to choose step 3a.

**Note:** Hugging Face Spaces host model demos provided by individuals not associated with Hugging Face or AskUI. Don't use these models on screens with sensible information.

**Supported Models:**
- [`AskUI/PTA-1`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AskUI/PTA-1)
- [`OS-Copilot/OS-Atlas-Base-7B`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxiw/OS-ATLAS)
- [`showlab/ShowUI-2B`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/showlab/ShowUI)
- [`Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxiw/Qwen2-VL-Detection)
- [`Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxiw/Qwen2-VL-Detection)

**Example Code:**
```python
    agent.click("search field", model="OS-Copilot/OS-Atlas-Base-7B")
```

### 3c. Host your own **AI Models**

#### UI-TARS

You can use Vision Agent with UI-TARS if you provide your own UI-TARS API endpoint.

1. Step: Host the model locally or in the cloud. More information about hosting UI-TARS can be found [here](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment).

2. Step: Provide the `TARS_URL`, `TARS_API_KEY`, and `TARS_MODEL_NAME` environment variables to Vision Agent.

3. Step: Use the `model="tars"` parameter in your `click()`, `get()` and `act()` etc. commands or when initializing the `VisionAgent`. The TARS model will be automatically registered if the environment variables are available.

**Example Code:**
```python
# Set environment variables before running this code:
# TARS_URL=http://your-tars-endpoint.com/v1
# TARS_API_KEY=your-tars-api-key
# TARS_MODEL_NAME=your-model-name

from askui import VisionAgent


# Use TARS model directly
with VisionAgent(model="tars") as agent:
    agent.click("Submit button")  # Uses TARS automatically
    agent.get("What's on screen?")  # Uses TARS automatically
    agent.act("Search for flights")  # Uses TARS automatically
```


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Building

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

# Initialize your agent context manager
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Use the webbrowser tool to start browsing
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.google.com")

    # Start to automate individual steps
    agent.click("url bar")
    agent.type("http://www.google.com")
    agent.keyboard("enter")

    # Extract information from the screen
    datetime = agent.get("What is the datetime at the top of the screen?")
    print(datetime)

    # Or let the agent work on its own, needs an Anthropic key set
    agent.act("search for a flight from Berlin to Paris in January")
```

### üéõÔ∏è Model Choice

You can choose different models for each `click()` (`act()`, `get()`, `locate()` etc.) command using the `model` parameter.

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

# Use AskUI's combo model for all commands
with VisionAgent(model="askui-combo") as agent:
    agent.click("Next")  # Uses askui-combo
    agent.get("What's on screen?")  # Uses askui-combo

# Use different models for different tasks
with VisionAgent(model={
    "act": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",  # Use Claude for act()
    "get": "askui",  # Use AskUI for get()
    "locate": "askui-combo",  # Use AskUI combo for locate() (and click(), mouse_move())
}) as agent:
    agent.act("Search for flights")  # Uses Claude
    agent.get("What's the current page?")  # Uses AskUI
    agent.click("Submit")  # Uses AskUI combo

# You can still override the default model for individual commands
with VisionAgent(model="askui-combo") as agent:
    agent.click("Next")  # Uses askui-combo (default)
    agent.click("Previous", model="askui-pta")  # Override with askui-pta
    agent.click("Submit")  # Back to askui-combo (default)
```

The following models are available:

</details>


### üîß Custom Models

You can create and use your own models by subclassing the `ActModel` (used for `act()`), `GetModel` (used for `get()`), or `LocateModel` (used for `click()`, `locate()`, `mouse_move()`) classes and registering them with the `VisionAgent`.

Here's how to create and use custom models:

```python
import functools
from askui import (
    ActModel,
    ActSettings,
    GetModel,
    LocateModel,
    Locator,
    ImageSource,
    MessageParam,
    ModelComposition,
    ModelRegistry,
    OnMessageCb,
    Point,
    ResponseSchema,
    VisionAgent,
)
from typing import Type
from typing_extensions import override

# Define custom models
class MyActModel(ActModel):
    @override
    def act(
        self,
        messages: list[MessageParam],
        model_choice: str,
        on_message: OnMessageCb | None = None,
        tools: list[Tool] | None = None,
        settings: ActSettings | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        # Implement custom act logic, e.g.:
        # - Use a different AI model
        # - Implement custom business logic
        # - Call external services
        if len(messages) > 0:
            goal = messages[0].content
            print(f"Custom act model executing goal: {goal}")
        else:
            error_msg = "No messages provided"
            raise ValueError(error_msg)

# Because Python supports multiple inheritance, we can subclass both `GetModel` and `LocateModel` (and even `ActModel`)
# to create a model that can both get and locate elements.
class MyGetAndLocateModel(GetModel, LocateModel):
    @override
    def get(
        self,
        query: str,
        source: Source,
        response_schema: Type[ResponseSchema] | None,
        model_choice: str,
    ) -> ResponseSchema | str:
        # Implement custom get logic, e.g.:
        # - Use a different OCR service
        # - Implement custom text extraction
        # - Call external vision APIs
        return f"Custom response to query: {query}"


    @override
    def locate(
        self,
        locator: str | Locator,
        image: ImageSource,
        model_choice: ModelComposition | str,
    ) -> PointList:
        # Implement custom locate logic, e.g.:
        # - Use a different object detection model
        # - Implement custom element finding
        # - Call external vision services
        return [(100, 100)]  # Example coordinates


# Create model registry
custom_models: ModelRegistry = {
    "my-act-model": MyActModel(),
    "my-get-model": MyGetAndLocateModel(),
    "my-locate-model": MyGetAndLocateModel(),
}

# Initialize agent with custom models
with VisionAgent(models=custom_models) as agent:
    # Use custom models for specific tasks
    agent.act("search for flights", model="my-act-model")

    # Get information using custom model
    result = agent.get(
        "what's the current page title?",
        model="my-get-model"
    )

    # Click using custom locate model
    agent.click("submit button", model="my-locate-model")

    # Mix and match with default models
    agent.click("next", model="askui")  # Uses default AskUI model
```

You can also use model factories if you need to create models dynamically:

```python
class DynamicActModel(ActModel):
    @override
    def act(
        self,
        messages: list[MessageParam],
        model_choice: str,
        on_message: OnMessageCb | None = None,
        tools: list[Tool] | None = None,
        settings: ActSettings | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        pass

# going to be called each time model is chosen using `model` parameter
def create_custom_model(api_key: str) -> ActModel:
    return DynamicActModel()


# if you don't want to recreate a new model on each call but rather just initialize
# it lazily
@functools.cache
def create_custom_model_cached(api_key: str) -> ActModel:
    return DynamicActModel()


# Register model factory
custom_models: ModelRegistry = {
    "dynamic-model": lambda: create_custom_model("your-api-key"),
    "dynamic-model-cached": lambda: create_custom_model_cached("your-api-key"),
    "askui": lambda: create_custom_model_cached("your-api-key"), # overrides default model
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": lambda: create_custom_model_cached("your-api-key"), # overrides model
}


with VisionAgent(models=custom_models, model="dynamic-model") as agent:
    agent.act("do something") # creates and uses instance of DynamicActModel
    agent.act("do something") # creates and uses instance of DynamicActModel
    agent.act("do something", model="dynamic-model-cached") # uses new instance of DynamicActModel as it is the first call
    agent.act("do something", model="dynamic-model-cached") # reuses cached instance
```

### üîÄ OpenRouter **AI Models**

You can use Vision Agent with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to access a wide variety of models via a unified API.

**Set your OpenRouter API key:**

<details>
  <summary>Linux & MacOS</summary>

  ```shell
  export OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Windows PowerShell</summary>

  ```shell
  $env:OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY="<your-openrouter-api-key>"
  ```
</details>

**Example: Using OpenRouter with a custom model registry**

```python
from askui import VisionAgent
from askui.models import (
    OpenRouterModel,
    OpenRouterSettings,
    ModelRegistry,
)


# Register OpenRouter model in the registry
custom_models: ModelRegistry = {
    "my-custom-model": OpenRouterModel(
        OpenRouterSettings(
            model="anthropic/claude-opus-4",
        )
    ),
}

with VisionAgent(models=custom_models, model={"get":"my-custom-model"}) as agent:
    result = agent.get("What is the main heading on the screen?")
    print(result)
```


### üõ†Ô∏è Direct Tool Use

Under the hood, agents are using a set of tools. You can directly access these tools.

#### Agent OS

The controller for the operating system.

```python
agent.tools.os.click("left", 2) # clicking
agent.tools.os.mouse_move(100, 100) # mouse movement
agent.tools.os.keyboard_tap("v", modifier_keys=["control"]) # Paste
# and many more
```

#### Web browser

The webbrowser tool powered by [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html) allows you to directly access webbrowsers in your environment.

```python
agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.google.com")
# also check out open and open_new_tab
```

#### Clipboard

The clipboard tool powered by [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip) allows you to interact with the clipboard.

```python
agent.tools.clipboard.copy("...")
result = agent.tools.clipboard.paste()
```

### üìú Logging

You want a better understanding of what you agent is doing? Set the `log_level` to DEBUG.

```python
import logging

with VisionAgent(log_level=logging.DEBUG) as agent:
    agent...
```

### üìú Reporting

You want to see a report of the actions your agent took? Register a reporter using the `reporters` parameter.

```python
from typing import Optional, Union
from typing_extensions import override
from askui.reporting import SimpleHtmlReporter
from PIL import Image

with VisionAgent(reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter()]) as agent:
    agent...
```

You can also create your own reporter by implementing the `Reporter` interface.

```python
from askui.reporting import Reporter

class CustomReporter(Reporter):
    @override
    def add_message(
        self,
        role: str,
        content: Union[str, dict, list],
        image: Optional[Image.Image | list[Image.Image]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        # adding message to the report (see implementation of `SimpleHtmlReporter` as an example)
        pass

    @override
    def generate(self) -> None:
        # generate the report if not generated live (see implementation of `SimpleHtmlReporter` as an example)
        pass


with VisionAgent(reporters=[CustomReporter()]) as agent:
    agent...
```

You can also use multiple reporters at once. Their `generate()` and `add_message()` methods will be called in the order of the reporters in the list.

```python
with VisionAgent(reporters=[SimpleHtmlReporter(), CustomReporter()]) as agent:
    agent...
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Monitor Support

You have multiple monitors? Choose which one to automate by setting `display` to `1`, `2` etc. To find the correct display or monitor, you have to play play around a bit setting it to different values. We are going to improve this soon. By default, the agent will use display 1.

```python
with VisionAgent(display=1) as agent:
    agent...
```

### üéØ Locating elements

If you have a hard time locating (clicking, moving mouse to etc.) elements by simply using text, e.g.,

```python
agent.click("Password textfield")
agent.type("********")
```

you can build more sophisticated locators.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Support can vary depending on the model you are using. Currently, only, the `askui` model provides best support for locators. This model is chosen by default if `ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID` and `ASKUI_TOKEN` environment variables are set and it is not overridden using the  `model` parameter.

Example:

```python
from askui import locators as loc

password_textfield_label = loc.Text("Password")
password_textfield = loc.Element("textfield").right_of(password_textfield_label)

agent.click(password_textfield)
agent.type("********")
```

### üìä Extracting information

The `get()` method allows you to extract information from the screen. You can use it to:

- Get text or data from the screen
- Check the state of UI elements
- Make decisions based on screen content
- Analyze static images

#### Basic usage

```python
# Get text from screen
url = agent.get("What is the current url shown in the url bar?")
print(url)  # e.g., "github.com/login"

# Check UI state
# Just as an example, may be flaky if used as is, better use a response schema to check for a boolean value (see below)
is_logged_in = agent.get("Is the user logged in? Answer with 'yes' or 'no'.") == "yes"
if is_logged_in:
    agent.click("Logout")
else:
    agent.click("Login")
```

#### Using custom images and PDFs

Instead of taking a screenshot, you can analyze specific images or PDFs:

```python
from PIL import Image
from askui import VisionAgent

# From PIL Image
with VisionAgent() as agent:
  image = Image.open("screenshot.png")
  result = agent.get("What's in this image?", source=image)

  # From file path
  result = agent.get("What's in this image?", source="screenshot.png")

  # From PDF
  result = agent.get("What is this PDF about?", source="document.pdf")
```

#### Using response schemas

For structured data extraction, use Pydantic models extending `ResponseSchemaBase`:

```python
from askui import ResponseSchemaBase, VisionAgent
from PIL import Image
import json

class UserInfo(ResponseSchemaBase):
    username: str
    is_online: bool

class UrlResponse(ResponseSchemaBase):
    url: str

class NestedResponse(ResponseSchemaBase):
    nested: UrlResponse

class LinkedListNode(ResponseSchemaBase):
    value: str
    next: "LinkedListNode | None"

with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Get structured data
    user_info = agent.get(
        "What is the username and online status?",
        response_schema=UserInfo
    )
    print(f"User {user_info.username} is {'online' if user_info.is_online else 'offline'}")

    # Get URL as string
    url = agent.get("What is the current url shown in the url bar?")
    print(url)  # e.g., "github.com/login"

    # Get URL as Pydantic model from image at (relative) path
    response = agent.get(
        "What is the current url shown in the url bar?",
        response_schema=UrlResponse,
        source="screenshot.png",
    )

    # Dump whole model
    print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
    # or
    response_json_dict = response.model_dump(mode="json")
    print(json.dumps(response_json_dict, indent=2))
    # or for regular dict
    response_dict = response.model_dump()
    print(response_dict["url"])

    # Get boolean response from PIL Image
    is_login_page = agent.get(
        "Is this a login page?",
        response_schema=bool,
        source=Image.open("screenshot.png"),
    )
    print(is_login_page)

    # Get integer response
    input_count = agent.get(
        "How many input fields are visible on this page?",
        response_schema=int,
    )
    print(input_count)

    # Get float response
    design_rating = agent.get(
        "Rate the page design quality from 0 to 1",
        response_schema=float,
    )
    print(design_rating)

    # Get nested response
    nested = agent.get(
        "Extract the URL and its metadata from the page",
        response_schema=NestedResponse,
    )
    print(nested.nested.url)

    # Get recursive response
    linked_list = agent.get(
        "Extract the breadcrumb navigation as a linked list",
        response_schema=LinkedListNode,
    )
    current = linked_list
    while current:
        print(current.value)
        current = current.next
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:**
- The support for response schemas varies among models. Currently, the `askui` model provides best support for response schemas
  as we try different models under the hood with your schema to see which one works best.
- PDF processing is only supported for Gemini models hosted on AskUI and for PDFs up to 20MB.

## What is AskUI Vision Agent?

**AskUI Vision Agent** is a versatile AI powered framework that enables you to automate computer tasks in Python.

It connects Agent OS with powerful computer use models like Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and the AskUI Prompt-to-Action series. It is your entry point for building complex automation scenarios with detailed instructions or let the agent explore new challenges on its own.

**Agent OS** is a custom-built OS controller designed to enhance your automation experience.

 It offers powerful features like
 - multi-screen support,
 - support for all major operating systems (incl. Windows, MacOS and Linux),
 - process visualizations,
 - real Unicode character typing

and more exciting features like application selection, in background automation and video streaming are to be released soon.


## Telemetry

By default, we record usage data to detect and fix bugs inside the package and improve the UX of the package including
- version of the `askui` package used
- information about the environment, e.g., operating system, architecture, device id (hashed to protect privacy), python version
- session id
- some of the methods called including (non-sensitive) method parameters and responses, e.g., the click coordinates in `click(x=100, y=100)`
- exceptions (types and messages)
- AskUI workspace and user id if `ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID` and `ASKUI_TOKEN` are set

If you would like to disable the recording of usage data, set the `ASKUI__VA__TELEMETRY__ENABLED` environment variable to `False`.


## Experimental

### AskUI Chat

AskUI Chat is a web application that allows interacting with an AskUI Vision Agent similar how it can be
done with `VisionAgent.act()` or `AndroidVisionAgent.act()` but in a more interactive manner that involves less code. Aside from
telling the agent what to do, the user can also demonstrate what to do (currently, only
clicking is supported).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** AskUI Chat is currently in an experimental stage and has several limitations (see below).

#### Architecture

This repository only includes the AskUI Chat API (`src/askui/chat`). The AskUI Chat UI can be accessed through the [AskUI Hub](https://hub.askui.com/) and connects to the local Chat API after it has been started.

#### Configuration

To use the chat, configure the following environment variables:

- `ASKUI_TOKEN`: AskUI Vision Agent behind chat uses currently the AskUI API
- `ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID`: AskUI Vision Agent behind chat uses currently the AskUI API
- `ASKUI__CHAT_API__DATA_DIR` (optional, defaults to `$(pwd)/chat`): Currently, the AskUI chat stores all data in a directory locally. You can change the default directory by setting this environment variable.
- `ASKUI__CHAT_API__HOST` (optional, defaults to `127.0.0.1`): The host to bind the chat API to.
- `ASKUI__CHAT_API__PORT` (optional, defaults to `9261`): The port to bind the chat API to.
- `ASKUI__CHAT_API__LOG_LEVEL` (optional, defaults to `info`): The log level to use for the chat API.

#### Installation

```bash
pip install askui[chat]
```

You may need to give permissions on the fast run of the Chat UI to demonstrate actions (aka record clicks).

#### Usage

```bash
python -m askui.chat
```

You can use the chat to record a workflow and redo it later. For that, just tell the agent to redo all previous steps.

- *Not efficient enought?* If some of the steps can be omitted in the rerun, you can just delete them or tell the agent to skip unnecessary steps.
- *Agent not doing what you want it to?*
    - The agent may get confused with the coordinates of clicks demonstrated by the user as it seems to use other coordinates. To omit this just tell the agent that the coordinates may have changed in the meanwhile and that it should take screenshots along the way to determine where to click.
    - It may also be helpful to tell the agent to first explain its understanding of the user's goal after having demonstrated some actions or before trying to get it to redo what has been done so that the agent can focus on the overarching goal instead of being reliant on specific actions.

#### Limitations

- A lot of errors are not handled properly and we allow the user to do a lot of actions that can lead to errors instead of properly guiding the user.
- The chat currently only allows rerunning actions through `VisionAgent.act()` (or `AndroidVisionAgent.act()` or `WebVisionAgent.act()`) which can be expensive, slow and is not necessary the most reliable way to do it.
- A lot quirks in UI and API.
- Currently, api and ui need to be run in dev mode.
- When demonstrating actions, the corresponding screenshot may not reflect the correct state of the screen before the action. In this case, cancel demonstrating, delete messages and try again.
- Currently, we only allow a maximum of 100 messages per conversation.
- When demonstrating actions, actions may be recorded that you did not want to record, e.g., stopping the demonstration. Just delete these messages afterwards.
- The agent is going to fail if there are no messages in the conversation, there is no tool use result message following the tool use message somewhere in the conversation, a message is too long etc.
  Just adding or deleting the message in this case should fix the issue.
- You should not switch the conversation while waiting for an agent's answers or demonstrating actions.

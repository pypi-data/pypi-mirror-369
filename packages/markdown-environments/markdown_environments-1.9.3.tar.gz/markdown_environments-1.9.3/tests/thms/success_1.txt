# Section {{1}}: this is theorem counter syntax from ThmsExtension()

## Subsection {{0,1}}: Bees

Here we begin our study of bees.



\begin{thm}[the bee theorem]
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
\end{pf}



\begin{thm\*}{hidden thm name used as `id`; not real LaTeX syntax}
Bees, of course, fly anyways.
\end{thm\*}

\begin{pf}[Proofs are configured to have titles override the heading]{hidden names are useless when there's already a name}
Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
\end{pf}



\begin{exer}

\begin{summary}
Prove that this `summary` environment is common to all dropdown-based environments.
\end{summary}

Solution: by reading the documentation, of course!
\end{exer}



\begin{exer}
All dropdowns initialized in `ThmsExtension()` have a default `summary` value of `thm_type`,
so using dropdowns like `pf` and `exer` here without a `summary` block is also fine.
\end{exer}

r"""
The base Markdown syntax defined by this extension is::

    \begin{...}
    ...
    \end{...}

Important:
    - There must be a blank line before each `\\begin{}` and after each `\\end{}`.
    - Only nesting different types of environments works; nesting the same environment within itself does not.
    - However, the `summary` part of a dropdown cannot contain other dropdowns with summaries, as the `summary`
      environment of the nested dropdown will not work.

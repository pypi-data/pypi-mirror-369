1.0.0 (2015-06-29)
------------------

- feature: support pkg, file include in header option. This allows us to
  include files with generated zrt-replace arguments. One usecase for this new
  option is the new cdn extraction concept which is able to version each
  resource file based on subversion version or the related package version.
  This new concept generates a file including all the related zrt-replace.less
  rules.

- feature: switch to json config file based minify script processing. This
  allows us to use larger headers and source files and isn't limited by
  cmd line length.

- feature: added option for extract each resource with it's own version based
  on subversion version. See p01.cdn version 1.0.0 for support cdn resources.

- feature: generate zrt-replace.less for extracted resources including all
  the related zrt-replace rules. This file can get included as header option
  in the p01.recipe.cdn:minify recipe

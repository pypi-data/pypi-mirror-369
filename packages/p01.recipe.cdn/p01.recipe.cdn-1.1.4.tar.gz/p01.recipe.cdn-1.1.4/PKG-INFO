Description: The ``p01.recipe.cdn:app`` recipe generates a script which is able to extract
        content delivery resources defined by the p01.cdn meta directives from a
        project to a given folder. Additional there is a minify recipe which generates
        a minify script which is able to collect resources from a local project or
        released python packages, minify and bundle them. And there is a glue recipe
        which is able to generate sprite images. In short words, three is everything
        you will need to generate and extract resources for a content delivery network.

        This buildout recipe package offers 3 different concepts. This 3 concept allows
        you to reduce the resources size and offload the resources from your
        application server. The nice thing is, that you can start your application with
        different configurations if you like to server the minified and static or the
        local non monified resource versions. The p01.cdn package also offers a version
        manager which allows to use different resource versioning concepts.
        
        Since version 1.0.0 this package is offering versiong per file and doesn't
        require to use one version for all resources. The optinal p01.recipe.cdn:setup
        recipe creates a script which is able to generate a version map and the related
        zrt-replace directives and stores them in a json data map and a less file
        which can get included in your related less files.
        
        
        sprites
        -------
        
        The first concept allows to generate sprite images and the relevant css styles
        pointing to the right sprite background position. This recipe uses the
        spritemapper python package
        
        
        minify
        ------
        
        The second concept allows to minify javascript or CSS files. The recipe supports
        the following python minify libraries.
        
          jsmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsmin
          lpjsmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lpjsmin
          slimit: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimit
          cssmin: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssmin
        
        
        content delivery network
        ------------------------
        
        The third concept allows to extract CDN (content delivery network) resources
        based on p01.cdn into a folder structure.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.1.4 (2025-08-15)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix; fix broken sprites processing, Skip PIL.VERSION access which is gone.
        
        
        1.1.3 (2025-07-18)
        ------------------
        
        - make code python 3 compatible
        
        
        1.1.2 (2015-09-11)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: fix broken i18n cdn resource path extraction
        
        
        1.1.1 (2015-09-03)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: use better error message if a zrt-resource include fails because
          of a missing resource (adapter) lookup.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2015-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: check version before write the verisons and zrt-replace directives
          the the related files. This prevents that the less compiler get invoked for
          nothing because fo the modified zrt-replace.less file.
        
        - bugfix: fix i18n resource extraction
        
        
        1.0.0 (2015-06-29)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: support pkg, file include in header option. This allows us to
          include files with generated zrt-replace arguments. One usecase for this new
          option is the new cdn extraction concept which is able to version each
          resource file based on subversion version or the related package version.
          This new concept generates a file including all the related zrt-replace.less
          rules.
        
        - feature: switch to json config file based minify script processing. This
          allows us to use larger headers and source files and isn't limited by
          cmd line length.
        
        - feature: added option for extract each resource with it's own version based
          on subversion version. See p01.cdn version 1.0.0 for support cdn resources.
        
        - feature: generate zrt-replace.less for extracted resources including all
          the related zrt-replace rules. This file can get included as header option
          in the p01.recipe.cdn:minify recipe
        
        
        0.5.7 (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: support missing parser instance. The parser was missing for show an
          error message, e.g. missing directory path
        
        
        0.5.6 (2014-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        - extract: print the current layer
        
        
        0.5.5 (2014-05-08)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: The skip option didn't work. Now you can define optional files by
          it's filename and the minify script will only include this skipped files
          and not minify the file source.
        
        - bugfix: The libs option didn't work. Now you can define different minify
          libraries for each file.
        
        
        0.5.4 (2013-11-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Output the resource parameters when extract fails
        
        
        0.5.3 (2013-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: use an empty list as default skip option and not None
        
        
        0.5.2 (2013-03-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: support skip option in extract recipe. This allows to define a list
          of filenames thcih get not extracted to the output. This allows to skip the
          source files from get deployed to the cdn output folder.
        
        - feature: support slimit mangle, mangle_toplevel and cssmin wrap options. You
          can use them as slimit_mangle, slimit_mangle_toplevel and cssmin_wrap in your
          buildout.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2013-01-28)
        ------------------

*This library is unofficial and is NOT affiliated with the company that makes UPLIFT desks.*

⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️

This software controls the movement of large heavy things. Do NOT run this code if you are in the vicinity of a desk that you do NOT want to move, or even *suspect* that you *could* be in the vicinity of such a desk. No authentication is required to send commands to an Uplift BLE adapter; any person (or machine) with this code who is within range of an adapter can issue commands to the adapter and move the attached desk. That means if, for example, you run this code in your office full of standing desks, you could injure people or damage property.

**This software is provided “as‑is” without warranties of any kind, express or implied. The authors and maintainers are not responsible for any damage, injury, or malfunction that may result from using this software to control your desk or any other hardware. By using this tool, you agree to assume all risks and liabilities.**

## Compatibility
This library was originally written to support a BLE adapter sold by [Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) for use with their desks. However, Uplift Desk [whitelabels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product) (i.e., puts their branding on) hardware and firmware from a company called [Jiecang](https://www.jiecang.com/). Because several other desk companies also whitelabel Jiecang's products, we suspect that this library *could be* compatible with desks from these other companies.

⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️

This library uses **undocumented**, **vendor-specific commands** that can access hidden desk functions beyond normal user controls, including minimum/maximum height limits, motor speed, and leg synchronization. **This poses real safety risks.**

Additionally, a command that appears to work safely on one brand (e.g., Uplift Desk) may trigger completely different and potentially dangerous behavior on another brand (e.g., Desky), even if both use Jiecang components. The compatibility table below provides rough guidance based on unofficial feedback from developers, but **we DO NOT guarantee safety or functionality for any desk**. Use this library at your own risk. Always test commands cautiously with the desk clear of obstacles and be prepared to manually stop desk movement.

## Usage

The uplift-ble module includes two main classes, `DeskScanner` and `Desk`. Usage example:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
import sys

from uplift_ble.desk import Desk
from uplift_ble.scanner import DeskScanner


async def main():
    # The `DeskScanner` class is used to discover nearby desk adapters and their Bluetooth MAC addresses.
    devices = await DeskScanner.discover()

    if len(devices) == 0:
        print("Error: no desks found.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    elif len(devices) > 1:
        print("Error: multiple desks found. Exiting for safety.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # The `Desk` class represents a desk and supports the async context manager API.
    async with Desk(address=devices[0].address) as desk:
        height_before_move = await desk.get_current_height()
        await desk.move_up()
        height_after_move = await desk.get_current_height()
        print(
            f"Moved desk from height of {height_before_move} mm to {height_after_move} mm"
        )

    print("Done.")


def _configure_logging() -> None:
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s",
        datefmt="%H:%M:%S",
        stream=sys.stdout,
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    _configure_logging()
    asyncio.run(main())

```

## Reverse Engineering
Valid desk commands were discovered by some combination of the following techniques:
- Reverse-engineered from the source code of the [Uplift Desk App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.android.uplifts&hl=en_US) on Google Play
- Discovered by brute-force search of vendor-specific opcodes against an actual desk
- Referenced from existing work from Bennet Wendorf's [uplift-desk-controller](https://github.com/Bennett-Wendorf/uplift-desk-controller) repo

## Protocol

The [Uplift Desk Bluetooth adapter](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bluetooth-adapter-for-uplift-desk/) uses a proprietary byte-oriented protocol over the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). There are two vendor-defined characteristics: one for sending commands to the Bluetooth adapter (`0xFE61`) and one on which notifications are raised such that clients can receive information from the Bluetooth adapter (`0xFE62`).

| GATT Characteristic | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0xFE61              | Desk control. Clients write to this to send commands to the server. |
| 0xFE62              | Desk output. The server sends notifications on this for clients.    |

### Attribute Value Format
All attribute values sent to `0xFE61` (commands) and received from `0xFE62` (notifications) follow the same byte-oriented format. Each attribute value consists of two sync bytes (`0xF1F1` for commands, `0xF2F2` for notifications), an opcode byte, a length byte, an optional payload, a checksum byte, and a terminator byte (always `0x7E`).

#### Attribute Value Format, Commands:
```txt
0xF1 → sync byte, command packet, (1 of 2 bytes)
0xF1 → sync byte, command packet, (2 of 2 bytes)
0xXX → opcode (1 byte)
0xYY → length (1 byte)
0x.. → payload (0xYY byte(s))
0xZZ → (opcode + length + sum of all payload bytes) mod 256
0x7E → terminator (1 byte)
```

#### Attribute Value Format, Notifications:
```txt
0xF2 → sync byte, command packet, (1 of 2 bytes)
0xF2 → sync byte, command packet, (2 of 2 bytes)
0xXX → opcode (1 byte)
0xYY → length (1 byte)
0x.. → payload (0xYY byte(s))
0xZZ → (opcode + length + sum of all payload bytes) mod 256
0x7E → terminator (1 byte)
```

Some of commands above were found by reverse-engineering the Uplift app (v1.1.0) using tools such as JADX. Specifically, the authors read through the .java code for the activities within the `com.jiecang.app.android.aidesk` namespace. Other commands were found by exhaustive search over the range of all opcodes.

### Known Notifications

|--------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0x01   |       3        | Reports the height of the desk in 0.01 mm (10 µm) increments.                         | Unknown                                        |

| 0x28   |       2        | Reports height preset 4. Units vary by hardware/firmware. (2‑byte, big‑endian).       | Unknown                                        |

Most notification packets seem to have opcodes that match the opcode of an associated command packet.
For example, sending the command packet with opcode=0x01 triggers a notification packet with the same opcode,
containing the desk's current height.

**There are many notification packets whose opcodes and payload structures are unknown. PRs are welcome!**

### Explaining the Calibration Offset
The calibration offset adds a fixed offset to the height of the desk.
This table summarizes some examples of what the Desk's display shows for various calibration offsets when the desk is at its lowest point.

| Calibration Offset (mm) | Desk Unit | Display Reading                                                      |

## Security of the Uplift BLE Adapter
The Bluetooth adapter allows unauthenticated GATT commands to be sent to it (no pairing or encryption required). The Uplift app itself allows you to discover and connect to nearby desks without, for example, a pairing code.

The author thinks this is a bad idea. A malicious actor could easily write code (or use a library such as this one) to scan for nearby desks, connect to them without any explicit authorization, and either soft-brick them through a series of commands designed to make the desk impossible to move via the app or physical controller (see example below), or move desks when people do not intend for them to be moved.

## Making a New Release
Checkout a branch for the release:
```
git checkout -b release/X.Y.Z
```

Edit `pyproject.toml` and change version to `X.Y.Z` (where `X.Y.Z` is a semver, no "v" prefix):
```
version = "X.Y.Z"
```
Commit the version bump:
```
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
git push origin release/X.Y.Z
```
Create a PR from release/X.Y.Z to main.  
Merge the PR.
Checkout main and pull latest:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Then create and push a tag:
```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
Then create a GitHub release. Choose the tag "vX.Y.Z".  
Generate release notes.  
Click publish.

Publish to PyPI:
```bash
uv build
uv publish

# Clean up
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
```

## Prior Work
This project builds on the prior work of Bennett Wendorf's [uplift-desk-controller](https://github.com/Bennett-Wendorf/uplift-desk-controller) repo. In addition to publishing a Python library, they also authored a Home Assistant integration, [hass-uplift-desk](https://github.com/Bennett-Wendorf/hass-uplift-desk). The uplift-ble library was originally intended to be a fork of Bennett's repo, but grew in scope to be a standalone library. I am thankful for Bennett's work and contributions to open source software.

# BOSlib-GPU
This library is the extra pacage for [BOSlib](https://github.com/ogayuuki0202/BOSlib) that makes GPU parallel processing available.

## Key Features
- Short, concise code for 3D reconstruction and quantification
- GPU parallel processing 

## Warning

The BOSlib-GPU is still in its *beta* state. This means that
it still might have some bugs and the API may change. However, testing and contributing
is very welcome, especially if you can contribute with new algorithms and features.

    Represents a molecular structure and provides methods for manipulating

        Optimize the geometry of metal-ligand complexes using a specified force field.

        This method is specifically tailored for optimizing metal-ligand complexes. 
        If the system does not contain metals, it will redirect to the standard `optimize()` method,
        which is faster and more suitable for organic compounds.

        Parameters:
            algorithm (Literal["steepest", "conjugate"], optional): 
                Optimization algorithm to use. Options are:
                - "steepest": Steepest descent algorithm.
                - "conjugate": Conjugate gradient algorithm.
                Defaults to "steepest".

            steps (Optional[int], optional): 
                Number of optimization steps to perform. If None, a default value will be used.

            equilibrium (bool, optional): 
                Whether to enforce equilibrium conditions during optimization. Defaults to True.

            equi_threshold (float, optional): 
                Threshold for equilibrium convergence. Defaults to 1e-4.

            max_iter (int, optional): 
                Maximum number of iterations for the optimizer. Defaults to 100.

            save_screenshot (bool, optional): 
                Whether to save a snapshot of the structure after optimization. Defaults to False.

        Notes:
            - For metal-ligand complexes, uses the Universal Force Field (UFF) for optimization, 
              with special handling of metal-ligand interactions.
            - Organic subcomponents are optimized separately, and constraints are applied to 
              non-metal atoms before proceeding with metal-ligand system optimization.
            - If no metal is detected in the structure, the slower metal-specific workflow 
              is bypassed in favor of the more efficient default optimization routine 
              (`optimize()`).

        Warnings:
            - When applied to organic compounds without metals, this method is slower 
              than the recommended `optimize()` method.

    Represents an abstraction of a molecular block.

    The MolBlock class provides an abstraction to represent and manage molecular 
    blocks, typically used in chemical or molecular modeling. It provides methods 
    and properties to interact with molecular attributes, rings, and other 
    chemical properties. The class supports controlled attribute setting, 
    retrieval, and enumeration while limiting certain operations like copying.

    Attributes:
        _attrs_dict (dict): Internal mapping of molecular attributes to their 
            respective processing functions.
        _attrs_setter (dict): Internal mapping of molecular attributes to their 
            respective setter functions.
        _default_attrs (dict): Default molecular attribute values.
        _attrs_enumerator (tuple): A tuple enumerating all attribute names in 
            _attrs_dict.

    Raises:
        PermissionError: When attempting to copy an instance of MolBlock.

    Methods:
        __repr__: Returns a string representation of the MolBlock instance.
        __copy__: Restricts copying of the MolBlock instance; raises PermissionError.
        __dir__: Modifies the directory of attributes to include the molecular 
            attributes in _attrs_enumerator.
        __getattr__: Retrieves a molecular attribute's value based on its processor 
            function or delegates to the parent class for non-existent attributes.
        __setattr__: Sets an attribute using a custom setter function; defaults to 
            a custom handler for key-value assignment.
        _default_attr_setter: Default attribute setter function for numerical values.
        attrs_enumerator: Property to get the tuple of molecular attribute names.
        attr_dict: Property to get a dictionary mapping attribute names to values.
        in_ring: Property to check if the molecular block is part of any ring.
        in_organic: Property to check if the molecular block belongs to an 
            organic molecule.
        rings: Property to get a list of rings involving the molecular block.
        setattr: Method for batch attribute setting, optionally including 
            default values.

        Calculate the dihedral angle formed by four points.

        This static method computes the dihedral angle, measured in degrees or radians,
        for four consecutive points in space. The input points are specified as array-like
        structures. The computation determines the angle formed by the planes defined
        by the four points.

            a (ArrayLike): The first point in the sequence, given in Cartesian coordinates.

            c (ArrayLike): The third point in the sequence, given in Cartesian coordinates.

            return_degree (bool, optional): Determines the unit of the returned angle.
                If True, the angle is returned in degrees. If False, the angle is returned
                in radians. Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            float: The computed dihedral angle in degrees or radians, based on the value
                of the return_degree parameter.

    Module for Common Molecular Fragment Actions (extension for hotpot-zzy)

    This module defines reusable functions and classes for manipulating molecular structures by
    attaching or grafting molecular fragments onto parent molecules, as part of a molecular
    generation or editing pipeline. It is designed as an extension to the hotpot-zzy package—see
    https://github.com/Zhang-Zhiyuan-zzy/hotpot—for integration with its molecular modeling framework.

    Core Concepts and Dependencies (from hotpot-zzy):
    - `Molecule`: Core class representing a chemical structure with accessible atoms, bonds, and methods such as
        `add_component`, `add_bonds`, `remove_atoms`, and `remove_bonds`.
    - Atoms and bonds are manipulated via their attributes (e.g., `atom.idx`, `atom.neighbours`, `bond.bond_order`)
        and linking methods (e.g., `atom.link_with`).
    - `Searcher`: Utility for locating potential attachment sites ('hits') in a parent molecule.

    Key Components:
    ----------------

    1. atom_link_atom_action(mol, hit, frag, action_points):
        - Action function to form a single bond between an atom in the parent molecule (`mol`, at index from `hit`)
          and an atom in the fragment (`frag`, at index from `action_points`). Uses hotpot's low-level atom
          linkage method for rapid attachment.

    2. shoulder_bond_action(mol, hit, frag, action_points):
        - More complex action for replacing a bond in the parent molecule: attaches a molecular fragment to the parent by
          removing a bond (between two atoms specified in `hit`), inserting a new fragment, and remapping connectivity.
          Handles bond order preservation and atom bookkeeping using hotpot-zzy's molecule methods.

    3. Fragment class:
        - Encapsulates a fragment molecule, its action points, a searcher (for finding graft locations in parents),
          and an action function (as above). Provides the `graft(mol)` method to generate modified molecules by applying
          the action at all valid sites located by the searcher.

    Hotpot-specific logic is used throughout:
    - Atom and bond manipulation leverages the hotpot `Molecule` API.
    - Atom and bond indexing strictly adheres to the molecule's internal representations.
    - Grafting and bond insertion/removal align with hotpot's design of molecular graph editing.

    Typical Usage:
    --------------
    - Define fragments and strategies for connecting them to parent molecules.
    - Use custom or hotpot-provided searchers to determine locations for molecular modification.
    - Apply `Fragment.graft` with a given molecule to produce a set of new structures.

    Note: These utilities expect valid `Molecule` and `Searcher` objects from the hotpot-zzy package
    and are not standalone.

    Links a single atom in the parent molecule to a single atom in the fragment by creating a single bond.

    This function takes two molecules—a parent molecule (`mol`) and a fragment (`frag`)—and connects the atom
    specified by `hit[0]` in the parent molecule to the atom specified by `action_points[0]` in the fragment,
    using a single chemical bond. Both `hit` and `action_points` must refer to exactly one atom each.

    Args:
        mol (Molecule): The parent molecule to which the fragment will be attached.
        hit (list[int]): A list containing a single integer, the index of the atom in `mol` to be linked.
        frag (Molecule): The fragment molecule to link to the parent.
        action_points (list[int]): A list containing a single integer, the index of the atom in `frag` to be linked.

    Returns:
        Molecule: The modified parent molecule with the fragment attached by a single bond.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `hit` or `action_points` does not contain exactly one element.

    Example:
        >>> new_molecule = atom_link_atom_action(mol, [3], frag, [0])
        # Links atom 3 in mol with atom 0 in frag by a single bond.

    Insert a fragment into the parent molecule by replacing a bond between two atoms.

    This function removes the bond between the two atoms specified by `hit` in the parent molecule,
    adds the fragment (with its atoms), and reconnects bonds to preserve molecular structure.
    Bonds and bond orders are preserved as appropriate.

    Args:
        mol (Molecule): The parent molecule (from hotpot-zzy).
        hit (list[int]): List of two indices, specifying the atoms in `mol` whose bond will be replaced.
        frag (Molecule): The fragment molecule to insert.

            to the parent molecule.

    Returns:
        Molecule: The modified parent molecule with the fragment inserted, previously connected atoms removed.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `hit` or `action_points` do not contain exactly two elements.

    Details:
        - Uses hotpot-zzy `add_component`, `add_bonds`, `remove_bonds`, and `remove_atoms`.
        - Ensures correct atom re-indexing and bond order preservation during insertion.

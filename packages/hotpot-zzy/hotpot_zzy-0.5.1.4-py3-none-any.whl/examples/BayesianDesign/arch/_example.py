        "full_method": "GFN2-xTB",  # Which  method to use for final cleaning/evaulating conformers.
        "assemble_method": "GFN2-xTB",  # Which method to use for assembling conformers.
        # For very large speedup - use "GFN-FF", though this is much less stable (especially for Lanthanides)
        # Additionaly, it is possible to use "UFF" - which is extremely fast. Though it is recommend to perform an XTB-level optimization
        # for the "full_method", or turn "relaxation" off.
        "xtb_solvent": 'none',  # Add any named XTB solvent!
        "xtb_accuracy": 1.0,  # Numerical Accuracy for XTB calculations

        "force_generation": False,
        # Whether to force the construction to proceed without xtb energies - defaults to UFF evaluation

        # Whether to force forcefield (FF) pre-optimization of fully-built complexes before final xtb evalulation.
        # FF preoptimization helps especially in cases where longer carbon chains are present that tend to overlap.
        # This option will also decrease the maximum force tolerance for xtb relaxation to 0.2 and set assemble_method='GFN-FF'
        # By default for acceleration.

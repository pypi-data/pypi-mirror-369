# What is libtpu?

`libtpu` is the core library that enables machine learning frameworks like
`JAX`, `PyTorch`, and `TensorFlow` to execute models on Google Cloud TPUs. It
provides core functionality for compilation, inter-chip communication (ICI), and
runtime execution.

`libtpu` also includes a set of SDK primitives for direct TPU interaction and
deployment.

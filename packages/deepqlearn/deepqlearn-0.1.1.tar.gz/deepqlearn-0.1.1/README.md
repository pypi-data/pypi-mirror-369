# DeepQlearn

A simple and clean **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementation in PyTorch, packaged for easy installation via PyPI.

---

## ✨ Features
- Minimal, readable code for learning DQN fundamentals
- Works with any [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) environment
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Replay buffer for experience sampling
- Target network updates for stable training
- Implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install deepqlearn
````

## Requirements:

```bash
Python >= 3.8
PyTorch
Gym
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from deepqlearn import train_dqn

# Train on CartPole for 200 episodes
train_dqn(episodes=200)
```

---

## 📚 API Reference

### `train_dqn(episodes=500, batch_size=64, target_update=10)`

Train a DQN agent on `CartPole-v1`.

**Parameters:**

* `episodes` *(int)* → Number of episodes to train for
* `batch_size` *(int)* → Mini-batch size for replay
* `target_update` *(int)* → Frequency (in episodes) to update the target network

---

### `DQNAgent`

A reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning.

**Constructor:**

```python
DQNAgent(
    state_dim,
    action_dim,
    lr=1e-3,
    gamma=0.99,
    epsilon=1.0,
    epsilon_min=0.01,
    epsilon_decay=0.995
)
```

**Key Methods:**

* `act(state)` → Choose an action given a state
* `remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` → Store experience in replay buffer
* `replay(batch_size)` → Train from replay buffer
* `update_target()` → Update target network with policy weights

---

## 📝 Example Training Script

```python
import gym
from deepqlearn import DQNAgent

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
agent = DQNAgent(env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n)

for episode in range(100):
    state = env.reset()[0]
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        agent.replay(batch_size=64)
        state = next_state
        total_reward += reward
    agent.update_target()
    print(f"Episode {episode} — Reward: {total_reward}")

env.close()
```

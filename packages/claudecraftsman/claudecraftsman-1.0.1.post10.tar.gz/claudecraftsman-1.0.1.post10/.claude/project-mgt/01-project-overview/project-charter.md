# ClaudeCraftsman Project Charter
*Establishing the foundation for artisanal software development*

**Document**: project-charter.md
**Created**: 2025-08-03
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active

## Project Vision

**Transform software development from task execution to purposeful creation, where every line of code is crafted with intention, every decision made with care, and every project built with pride.**

## Mission Statement

ClaudeCraftsman elevates AI-assisted development to the level of master craftsmanship by providing a framework where specialized AI agents work as artisanal craftspeople, each taking pride in their domain expertise and contributing to software that reflects true quality and intentional design.

## Core Values and Philosophy

### The Craftsman Mindset

**Intention Over Speed**: Every decision, every line of code, every document is created with purpose and thoughtful consideration. We reject the "move fast and break things" mentality in favor of "move thoughtfully and build lasting things."

**Quality Over Quantity**: We measure success not by lines of code written or features shipped, but by the elegance, maintainability, and user value of what we create. Each component should be something a craftsperson would be proud to show another master.

**Research Over Assumptions**: All technical and business decisions are backed by current, verifiable research. We cite our sources, validate our assumptions, and make evidence-based choices that stand up to scrutiny.

**Organization Over Chaos**: Clean, logical file structures and documentation aren't bureaucracy - they're the foundation that enables sustainable, collaborative development. Every file has its place, every document serves a purpose.

**Context Over Isolation**: Agents don't work in silos. Each craftsperson understands how their work fits into the larger vision and provides comprehensive handoffs that preserve knowledge and reasoning for future work.

### Craftsman Principles

1. **Take Pride in Your Work**: Every output reflects the quality standards of a master craftsperson
2. **Preserve Knowledge**: Document reasoning, decisions, and context for future craftspeople
3. **Research Before Building**: Validate assumptions and claims with authoritative sources
4. **Think Before Acting**: Use appropriate depth of analysis for the complexity of the problem
5. **Coordinate with Excellence**: Provide clear, comprehensive handoffs that enable others to excel
6. **Maintain Organization**: Follow consistent patterns that enable long-term project health
7. **Serve the User**: Every technical decision ultimately serves to create value for real people

## Project Objectives

## Project Scope

### In Scope - What We're Building

**Core Agent System**:
- Planning craftspeople: product-architect, design-architect, technical-planner
- Implementation craftspeople: system-architect, backend-architect, frontend-developer
- Coordination craftspeople: workflow-coordinator, context-manager

**Command Framework**:
- Design-first commands: /design, /workflow, /implement
- Support commands: /troubleshoot, /test, /document
- Native Claude Code integration with proper MCP tool usage

**Quality Infrastructure**:
- File organization standards and templates
- Research integration with citation requirements
- Context management and handoff protocols
- Migration tools and documentation

### Out of Scope - What We're Not Building

**External Dependencies**:
- Custom MCP server development
- Integration with external project management tools
- Real-time collaboration features
- Enterprise deployment automation

**Advanced Features**:
- AI model fine-tuning or custom training
- Advanced analytics beyond basic quality metrics
- Custom domain-specific agents beyond core set
- Integration with cloud platforms or CI/CD systems

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders

**Developer-Craftspeople** (Primary Users):
- Senior developers who value code quality and thoughtful development
- Users currently invested in SuperClaude workflows
- Teams wanting to adopt artisanal development practices
- **Needs**: Seamless migration, preserved workflows, enhanced quality tools

**Claude Code Community** (Secondary Users):
- Claude Code users seeking structured development approaches
- Developers interested in multi-agent workflows
- Teams looking for design-first development practices
- **Needs**: Native Claude Code integration, clear documentation, minimal setup

### Supporting Stakeholders

**Project Team**:
- Human collaborator: Requirements validation, testing, documentation review

## Risk Management

### High-Impact Risks

**Research Overhead Concern**:
- Risk: Users may view research requirements as burdensome
- Impact: Low adoption, resistance to quality practices

## Success Definition

**ClaudeCraftsman succeeds when developers can create software with the same pride, intention, and quality as master craftspeople create physical works of art.**

This means:
- Every specification is research-backed and thoughtfully crafted
- Every agent handoff preserves context and reasoning
- Every file has its proper place in an organized structure
- Every decision serves the ultimate goal of creating valuable software for real people

The framework succeeds not when it's fast, but when it enables the creation of software that developers are genuinely proud to have built.

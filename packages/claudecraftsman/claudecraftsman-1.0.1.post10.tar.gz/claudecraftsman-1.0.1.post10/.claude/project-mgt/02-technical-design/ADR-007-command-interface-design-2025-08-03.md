# Architecture Decision Record: Command Interface Design

**ADR Number**: ADR-007
**Decision Date**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: ClaudeCraftsman Project Team
**Decision Category**: User Interface

## Context

SuperClaude users are familiar with `/sc:` command patterns. ClaudeCraftsman needs to provide equivalent functionality while integrating with Claude Code's native command system.

## Decision

Implement native Claude Code commands that preserve SuperClaude workflow patterns.

**Command Mapping**:
- `/sc:workflow` → `/design` + `/workflow` + `/implement`
- `/sc:implement` → `/implement` with design integration
- `/sc:troubleshoot` → `/troubleshoot` with systematic analysis
- `/sc:test` → `/test` with comprehensive coverage
- `/sc:document` → `/document` with auto-generation

**Design Principles**:
- Native Claude Code integration (no external dependencies)
- Preserve familiar workflow patterns
- Enhance with research and quality standards
- Support multi-agent coordination

**Rationale**:
- Native commands provide better integration and performance
- Familiar patterns reduce learning curve for SuperClaude users
- Enhanced capabilities add value beyond feature parity
- Multi-agent coordination enables sophisticated workflows

## Consequences

### Positive
- Native Claude Code integration with enhanced capabilities
- Familiar patterns for SuperClaude users
- No external dependencies or setup complexity
- Enhanced quality and research integration

### Negative
- Command syntax may differ slightly from SuperClaude
- Learning curve for enhanced capabilities
- Complexity of multi-agent coordination
- Risk of feature gaps during initial implementation

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive migration guide mapping old to new commands
- Documentation highlighting enhanced capabilities
- Phased rollout with feedback incorporation
- Clear escalation path for missing features

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Executive Summary

## Project at a Glance

**ClaudeCraftsman** transforms software development into an artisanal craft where specialized AI craftspeople work with intention, care, and pride. The framework preserves SuperClaude's structured workflows while adding research-driven development, professional documentation standards, and native Claude Code integration.

**Status**: Foundation Complete - Ready for Phase 1 Implementation
**Timeline**: 4-phase development approach with quality-driven progression
**Team**: Human collaborator + Claude assistant using craftsman principles

## The Vision

### From Task Execution to Purposeful Creation

Traditional AI development tools focus on speed: "move fast and break things." ClaudeCraftsman focuses on quality: "move thoughtfully and build lasting things."

**The Craftsman Difference**:
- **Intention Over Speed**: Every decision made with purpose and care
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Success measured by elegance and user value
- **Research Over Assumptions**: All decisions backed by verifiable evidence
- **Organization Over Chaos**: Clean structures enabling long-term maintenance
- **Context Over Isolation**: Seamless coordination between specialized craftspeople

### Who We Serve

**Primary Users**: Developer-craftspeople who value thoughtful development and take pride in quality code
**Migration Target**: SuperClaude users seeking enhanced capabilities with familiar workflows
**Growth Market**: Claude Code users wanting structured, quality-focused development approaches

## The Solution

### Specialized AI Craftspeople

**Planning Artisans**:
- **product-architect**: Business requirements and market research master
- **design-architect**: Technical specifications and system design artisan
- **technical-planner**: Implementation planning and resource management craftsperson

**Implementation Craftspeople**:
- **system-architect**: High-level architecture with thoughtful consideration
- **backend-architect**: API and server development with quality focus
- **frontend-developer**: UI and user experience craftsmanship

**Coordination Artisans**:
- **workflow-coordinator**: Multi-agent workflow management

- **Independent Verification**: Citations enable third-party validation

### Professional Organization

Clean, logical file structures that prevent documentation sprawl:
- **Structured Hierarchy**: `.claude/` directory organization
- **Consistent Naming**: `TYPE-project-YYYY-MM-DD.md` format
- **Context Preservation**: Complete information across agent transitions
- **Quality Documentation**: Professional standards throughout

## Technical Architecture

### Native Claude Code Integration

**Built on Claude Code's native agent framework**:
- No external dependencies beyond MCP tools
- Better performance than external orchestration
- Seamless integration with Claude Code capabilities
- Clear upgrade path as Claude Code evolves

### Context Management System

**File-based context preservation**:
```
.claude/context/
├── WORKFLOW-STATE.md    # Current workflow and phase status
├── CONTEXT.md           # Project context and decisions
├── HANDOFF-LOG.md       # Agent transition history
└── SESSION-MEMORY.md    # Session continuity data
```

### Quality Assurance Framework

**Phase-based development with quality gates**:
- Phase progression only when standards are met
- Research requirements for all factual claims

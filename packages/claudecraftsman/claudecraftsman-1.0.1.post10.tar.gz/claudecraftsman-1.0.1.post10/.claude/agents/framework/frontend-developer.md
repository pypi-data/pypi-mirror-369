## Output Standards
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, composable components with clear interfaces
- **Accessibility Excellence**: WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance with comprehensive testing
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals targets met (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- **Design System Integration**: Consistent use of tokens, patterns, and components
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear usage guides with examples and accessibility notes

## Integration with Other Craftspeople
- **From design-architect**: Receive design specifications and component requirements
- **From product-architect**: Understand user stories and success metrics
- **To backend-architect**: Define API contracts and data requirements
- **To qa-architect**: Provide testing scenarios and accessibility requirements
- **With workflow-coordinator**: Maintain state and handoff documentation

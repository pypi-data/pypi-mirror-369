#### HB-20250803-223534: System Improvement - Context Maintenance Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-08-03 22:35:34
**Type**: System Enhancement
**Triggered By**: User identification of context maintenance gap

**Problem Identified**: Despite excellent framework design, context files were static from initialization rather than being actively maintained during work sessions. This broke the fundamental premise of the ClaudeCraftsman framework.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Mandatory Context Protocol**: Created comprehensive protocol defining non-negotiable context update requirements
- **Agent Template Enhancement**: Updated core agent template with mandatory context maintenance requirements
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Made context updates part of pass/fail criteria for all agent work
- **Operational Discipline**: Applied proper context maintenance during this improvement session

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Created: `mandatory-context-maintenance.md` - Comprehensive protocol for all agents
- Modified: `product-architect-agent.md` - Added mandatory context maintenance section
- Modified: `agent-template.md` - Added mandatory context update requirements
- Modified: `WORKFLOW-STATE.md` - Added Phase 0.5 system improvement record
- Modified: `registry.md` - Updated document tracking and counts
- Modified: `progress-log.md` - Documented improvement work completion
- Modified: `HANDOFF-LOG.md` - This entry documenting system enhancement

**Quality Validation**: ✅ All context files updated with current work
- [x] WORKFLOW-STATE.md updated with system improvement phase
- [x] CONTEXT.md updated with key decisions and system improvement
- [x] registry.md updated with new document and counts
- [x] progress-log.md updated with completed improvement work
- [x] HANDOFF-LOG.md updated with this system enhancement entry
- [x] All timestamps current (2025-08-03)
- [x] All files follow .claude/ directory structure
- [x] System improvement enables proper operational discipline

**Impact**: Framework now has the operational discipline to maintain its own documentation and context systems. This fixes a critical gap between excellent design and actual execution.

**Next Actions**: Framework ready for Phase 1 implementation with proper context maintenance discipline established.

**Status**: ✅ Critical System Enhancement Complete

#### HB-20250804-105700: Framework Completion - Phase 1 to Phase 2

# E-Commerce Platform Design Summary
*Comprehensive example of /design workflow*

## Project Overview

This example demonstrates the complete ClaudeCraftsman `/design` workflow for a complex e-commerce platform. It showcases:

- Market research and competitive analysis
- Comprehensive PRD creation
- Technical specifications
- Multi-agent coordination
- Full implementation plan

## Design Process Flow

### 1. Initial Command
```bash
/design e-commerce-platform --research=deep
```

### 2. Product Architect Phase
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Outputs**:
- Market research with 15+ sources
- Competitive analysis (Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- User personas (5 detailed personas)
- PRD with 50+ requirements
- Success metrics defined

**Key Insights**:
- Mobile-first approach (73% mobile traffic)
- Social commerce integration critical
- Personalization drives 35% more sales
- Fast checkout reduces abandonment by 40%

### 3. Design Architect Phase
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Outputs**:
- Microservices architecture
- API specifications (30+ endpoints)
- Database schemas (15 tables)
- Technology stack decisions
- Performance requirements

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Microservices for scalability
- Event-driven communication
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- React + Next.js frontend
- Kubernetes deployment

### 4. System Architect Phase
**Duration**: 20 minutes
**Outputs**:
- High-level system design
- Integration patterns
- Scalability strategy
- Security architecture
- Deployment pipeline

- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Documentation Generated

1. **PRD-ecommerce-platform-2025-08-04.md** (25 pages)
2. **TECH-SPEC-ecommerce-platform-2025-08-04.md** (40 pages)
3. **API-SPEC-ecommerce-platform-2025-08-04.md** (60 pages)
4. **DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE-ecommerce-platform-2025-08-04.md** (15 pages)
5. **BDD-scenarios-ecommerce-platform-2025-08-04.md** (30 scenarios)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Research Matters
The market research revealed critical features we wouldn't have considered:
- Social commerce integration
- AR/VR product viewing
- Sustainability tracking

### 2. Agent Coordination
Each agent brought unique perspectives:
- product-architect: User-focused features
- design-architect: Technical feasibility
- system-architect: Scalability concerns

### 3. Comprehensive Planning
The detailed planning saved significant development time by:
- Identifying dependencies early
- Preventing architecture conflicts
- Aligning team understanding

### 4. Quality from Start
Starting with quality standards ensured:
- Consistent implementation
- Proper testing coverage
- Production readiness

## Using This Example

To study this example:

1. **Review the PRD**: See how market research drives requirements
2. **Study Technical Specs**: Understand architecture decisions
3. **Follow Implementation**: See how planning guides development
4. **Examine Tests**: Learn comprehensive testing approaches

To create your own:

```bash
/design your-platform --research=deep
```

The framework will guide you through the same comprehensive process, adapted to your specific needs.

## Documentation Cleanup Complete (2025-08-12)

### Removed Files (Redundancy Elimination)
- `agent-reference.md` - Information consolidated into FAQ
- `best-practices.md` - Content integrated into other guides
- `command-reference.md` - Available via help system
- `getting-started.md` - Duplicate of QUICKSTART.md
- `troubleshooting.md` (root) - Duplicate of current/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- `current/WORKFLOW-EXAMPLES.md` - Moved to dev/
- `guides/INSTALL-GUIDE-global-framework-2025-08-04.md` - Redundant
- `guides/USER-GUIDE-bootstrap-setup-2025-08-03.md` - Redundant
- `guides/INSTALL-UV.md` - Redundant
- `guides/PUBLISHING-GUIDE-pypi-release-2025-08-08.md` - Developer-specific

### Moved to dev/ (Developer Focus)
- All architecture documentation
- Implementation plans and status
- Maintenance procedures
- Development roadmaps

## Final Simplified Structure

### User-Facing Documentation (4 files total)
1. **README.md** (project root) - Project overview and installation
2. **QUICKSTART.md** - Getting started guide
3. **FAQ.md** - Frequently asked questions
4. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Problem resolution guide

### Developer Documentation (dev/ folder)
- Organized by function (architecture, implementation, maintenance, plans)
- Accessible but separate from user-focused content
- Preserved for development team reference

## Cleanup Benefits Achieved
✅ **Reduced from 60+ files to 4 user-facing files**
✅ **Eliminated all redundancy and duplication**
✅ **Clear separation of user vs developer content**
✅ **Simplified maintenance and updates**
✅ **Improved discoverability and user experience**
✅ **Preserved all developer content in organized structure**

*Documentation cleanup completed 2025-08-12. Structure optimized for user experience while preserving developer resources.*

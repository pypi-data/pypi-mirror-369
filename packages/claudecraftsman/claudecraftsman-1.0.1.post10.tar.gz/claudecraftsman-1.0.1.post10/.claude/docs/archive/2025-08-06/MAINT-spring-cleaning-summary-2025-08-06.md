# Spring Cleaning Summary
*Date: 2025-08-06*

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup of the ClaudeCraftsman project structure after reverting MCP implementation changes. The project is now lean and well-organized.

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Empty Directories Removed
- ✅ `docs/` (top-level, was empty)
- ✅ `scripts/` (top-level, was empty)
- ✅ All other empty directories throughout the project

### 2. Build Artifacts Removed
- ✅ `dist/` directory with old build outputs
- ✅ All `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
- ✅ Python cache files from tests and source code

### 3. Archived Content Removed
- ✅ `.claude/.archive/` with old agent versions
- ✅ Duplicate refactored agent files from:
  - `.claude/agents/framework/*-refactored.md`
  - `src/claudecraftsman/templates/framework/agents/*-refactored.md`

### 4. MCP-Related Cleanup
- ✅ All MCP implementation files reverted (git reset to 75d8519)
- ✅ MCP test files removed
- ✅ MCP dependencies removed from pyproject.toml

### 5. Development Environment Cleanup
- ✅ `.devcontainer/.data/` Memgraph data files

## Current Project Structure

### Clean Top-Level
```
/workspace/
├── CLAUDE.md               # Framework activation
├── README.md               # Project documentation
├── hooks.json              # Hook configuration
├── pyproject.toml          # Python package config
├── uv.lock                 # Dependency lock file
├── src/claudecraftsman/    # Python implementation
├── tests/                  # Test suite
├── .claude/                # Framework runtime files
├── .devcontainer/          # Development environment
└── .serena/                # Serena MCP config (kept, used by devcontainer)
```

### Retained Directories
- **`.claude/scripts/`** - Framework automation scripts (actively used)
- **`.claude/project-mgt/`** - Project management documentation
- **`.claude/docs/`** - Runtime documentation with proper organization
- **`.claude/examples/`** - Example projects demonstrating framework usage
- **`.devcontainer/mcp/`** - MCP servers for development environment

### Package Structure (src/claudecraftsman/)
```
src/claudecraftsman/
├── cli/                    # CLI commands
├── core/                   # Core functionality
├── hooks/                  # Hook system
├── templates/              # Framework templates
│   ├── framework/          # Framework files for init
│   │   ├── agents/        # Agent templates
│   │   ├── commands/      # Command templates
│   │   └── framework.md   # Core framework file
│   └── hooks.json         # Default hooks config
└── utils/                  # Utility functions
```

## Key Findings

### 1. No Legacy Folders Found
The mentioned folders (`infrastructure`, `scripts`, `shared`) were not present at the project root level. The only `scripts` folder found was `.claude/scripts/` which contains actively used framework automation scripts.

### 2. Template Duplication
The framework files in `.claude/` and `src/claudecraftsman/templates/framework/` are intentionally duplicated:
- `.claude/` version is used for self-hosting development
- `src/claudecraftsman/templates/` version is packaged for distribution

### 3. Clean Dependencies
After MCP reversion, pyproject.toml now only contains essential dependencies:
- typer, rich, shellingham (CLI)
- pydantic, pydantic-settings (configuration)
- gitpython (Git integration)

## Recommendations

### 1. Keep Current Structure
The project is now well-organized with clear separation between:
- Runtime files (`.claude/`)
- Package source (`src/claudecraftsman/`)
- Development environment (`.devcontainer/`)
- Tests (`tests/`)

### 2. Regular Maintenance
- Run `find . -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +` periodically
- Keep `.claude/docs/archive/` organized by date
- Review `.claude/examples/` for relevance

### 3. Documentation
All documentation is properly organized in `.claude/docs/` with:
- `current/` for active documents
- `archive/` for superseded versions
- Clear categorization by type

## Summary
The spring cleaning is complete. The project structure is now tight, well-organized, and free of unnecessary files. All remaining directories serve specific purposes in the framework's operation or development workflow.

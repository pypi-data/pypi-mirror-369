# CLI Migration Complete
*Date: 2025-08-06*

## Overview
Successfully migrated all framework operations from bash scripts to Python CLI commands. The `.claude/scripts/` directory has been removed, and all references have been updated to use the `cc` (ClaudeCraftsman) CLI.

## Migration Summary

### 1. CLI Commands Added
- `cc state archive [filename] [reason]` - Archive documents with reason

### 2. Script to CLI Mapping
All scripts have been replaced with CLI equivalents:

| Old Script | New CLI Command |
|------------|-----------------|
| `framework-state-update.sh document-created` | `cc state document-created` |
| `framework-state-update.sh document-completed` | `cc state document-completed` |
| `framework-state-update.sh phase-started` | `cc state phase-started` |
| `framework-state-update.sh phase-completed` | `cc state phase-completed` |
| `framework-state-update.sh handoff` | `cc state handoff` |
| `enforce-quality-gates.sh` | `cc validate pre-operation` |
| `validate-operation.sh` | `cc validate pre-operation` |
| `auto-archive.sh` | `cc state archive` |

### 3. Files Updated
Updated all references from scripts to CLI commands in:
- `/workspace/src/claudecraftsman/templates/framework/commands/add.md`
- `/workspace/.claude/commands/add.md`
- `/workspace/.claude/agents/common/state-management.md`

### 4. Directory Removed
- Removed `/workspace/.claude/scripts/` directory entirely

## Benefits of CLI-Only Approach

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
- All functionality now in Python codebase
- No duplication between scripts and CLI
- Easier to maintain and evolve

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Python exceptions with meaningful messages
- Type checking and validation
- Consistent error reporting

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No bash dependency
- No shell scripting quirks

### 4. **Rich Output**
- Colored terminal output with Rich library
- Progress indicators and tables
- Better user experience

### 5. **Testability**
- Python code can be unit tested
- Integration tests possible
- Better quality assurance

## Usage Examples

### State Management
```bash
# Record document creation
cc state document-created "PRD-project.md" "PRD" "docs/current/" "Product requirements"

# Mark phase complete
cc state phase-completed "requirements" "product-architect" "PRD completed"

# Record handoff
cc state handoff "product-architect" "design-architect" "PRD ready for technical spec"

# Archive old document
cc state archive "OLD-SPEC.md" "Superseded by new version"

# Show current state
cc state show --workflow
```

### Quality Validation
```bash
# Run pre-operation checks
cc validate pre-operation

# Generate quality checklist
cc validate checklist --output checklist.md

# Run comprehensive validation
cc validate quality --phase implementation
```

## Framework Integration
All framework templates and commands now use CLI commands:
- Agent templates use `cc state` for updates
- Commands use `cc validate` for quality gates
- Workflows use `cc state handoff` for transitions

## Next Steps
1. Update any documentation that references old scripts
2. Train users on new CLI commands
3. Monitor for any edge cases not covered by CLI

The migration is complete and the framework is now fully CLI-driven! ðŸŽ‰

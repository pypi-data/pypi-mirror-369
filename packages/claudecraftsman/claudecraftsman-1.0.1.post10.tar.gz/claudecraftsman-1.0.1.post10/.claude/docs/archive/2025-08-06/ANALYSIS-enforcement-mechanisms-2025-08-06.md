## Comparative Analysis: Current CLI vs Lifecycle Hooks

### Framework Requirements vs Implementation

| Framework Requirement | Current CLI Implementation | Lifecycle Hook Potential | Gap Analysis |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Time Awareness** | ❌ Not enforced | ✅ Can validate MCP time usage | CLI cannot prevent hardcoded dates |
| **Research Driven** | ❌ Not validated | ✅ Can check MCP tool calls | No verification of research |
| **Citations Required** | ❌ Not checked | ✅ Can scan for citation patterns | Manual process only |
| **File Organization** | ⚠️ Partial (naming check) | ✅ Can block wrong locations | Limited to post-creation |
| **Quality Gates** | ⚠️ Manual trigger only | ✅ Automatic enforcement | Requires explicit CLI call |
| **Agent Coordination** | ✅ State commands exist | ✅ Auto-trigger on handoffs | Manual invocation needed |
| **Git Integration** | ⚠️ Basic checks only | ✅ Auto-commit with validation | No enforcement |

### State Management Comparison

| Operation | Current CLI | With Hooks | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Document Creation | `cc state document-created` (manual) | Auto-triggered on Write/Edit | 100% automatic |
| Registry Update | Manual command required | Automatic on file operations | No missed updates |
| Workflow Tracking | Manual phase updates | Auto-track based on activity | Real-time accuracy |
| Handoff Logging | Manual handoff command | Auto-detect agent switches | Context preserved |
| Git Operations | Manual commits | Auto-commit with messages | Consistent history |

## Proposed Hook Architecture

### 1. Framework Compliance Layer
```typescript
interface FrameworkCompliance {
  preValidation: {
    checkTimeContext(): boolean;
    validateNamingConvention(filename: string): boolean;
    ensureResearchEvidence(): boolean;
    verifyCitations(): boolean;
  };

  postEnforcement: {
    updateRegistry(file: string): void;
    trackProgress(operation: string): void;
    createSemanticCommit(): void;
    updateWorkflowState(): void;
  };
}
```

### 2. Deterministic Enforcement Rules

#### File Operations
```yaml
Write/Edit Tool:
  pre-conditions:
    - Must have time context from MCP
    - Filename must match conventions
    - Location must be approved
    - Registry must be current

  post-actions:
    - Update document registry
    - Log progress entry
    - Update workflow state
    - Stage for git commit
```

#### Research Documents
```yaml
PRD/SPEC/PLAN Creation:
  pre-conditions:
    - MCP research tools used in session
    - Citations present in content
    - Time context established

  validation:
    - Scan for [Statement]^[N] patterns
    - Verify source section exists
    - Check date formats use MCP time
```

### 3. Hook Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Validation Hooks
```python
# claudecraftsman/hooks/validators.py
class FrameworkValidator:
    def validate_time_awareness(self, content: str) -> bool:
        """Check for hardcoded dates vs MCP time usage"""

    def validate_citations(self, content: str) -> bool:
        """Verify citation patterns and sources"""

    def validate_naming(self, filename: str) -> bool:
        """Ensure naming convention compliance"""
```

#### Phase 2: Enforcement Hooks
```python
# claudecraftsman/hooks/enforcers.py
class FrameworkEnforcer:
    def enforce_pre_write(self, tool_args: dict) -> dict:
        """Modify or block non-compliant operations"""

    def enforce_post_write(self, result: dict) -> None:
        """Trigger required state updates"""
```

## Benefits of Hook-Based Enforcement

### 1. **Deterministic Compliance**
- No reliance on human memory
- Automatic enforcement of all standards
- Consistent application across sessions

### 2. **Real-Time Validation**
- Catch issues before they occur
- Immediate feedback on violations
- Suggested corrections inline

### 3. **Complete Automation**
- State management happens automatically
- Git commits generated with context
- Registry always current

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- Every operation logged
- Compliance metrics tracked
- Quality gates documented

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Core Enforcement
1. **Naming Convention Hook**: Block non-compliant filenames
2. **State Update Hook**: Auto-update on file operations
3. **Git Integration Hook**: Semantic commits on changes

### Priority 2: Quality Validation
1. **Time Context Hook**: Validate MCP time usage
2. **Citation Check Hook**: Ensure proper attribution
3. **Research Validation Hook**: Verify MCP tool usage

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
1. **Auto-Fix Hook**: Correct common issues
2. **Suggestion Hook**: Provide inline guidance
3. **Metrics Hook**: Track compliance rates

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Enhance Current Hooks
- Extend existing hooks in hooks.json
- Add validation logic to CLI
- Test with current workflow

### Step 2: Implement Enforcers
- Build pre/post operation validators
- Add blocking for non-compliance
- Create auto-correction features

### Step 3: Full Automation
- Remove manual CLI requirements
- Hooks handle all enforcement
- Monitor and optimize

## Conclusion

The current CLI provides good tools but relies on manual invocation. Lifecycle hooks can provide deterministic enforcement of all framework standards, ensuring 100% compliance without human intervention. This represents a significant improvement in framework adherence and developer experience.

## Testing Philosophy

ClaudeCraftsman testing follows the same craftsman principles as development: every test is designed with intention, serves a clear purpose, and contributes to the overall quality of the framework. We test not just functionality, but the artisanal qualities that make the framework worthy of a craftsperson's pride.

## Testing Objectives

### Primary Objectives

**Quality Assurance**: Validate that all outputs meet professional craftsperson standards consistently
**Workflow Preservation**: Ensure SuperClaude patterns are preserved while adding enhanced capabilities
**Research Integration**: Verify that all claims are properly backed by verifiable sources
**Context Preservation**: Validate that agent handoffs maintain complete information integrity
**User Experience**: Confirm that the framework enables productive, prideful development practices

### Success Criteria

**Technical Success**: All functional requirements work as specified with craftsman quality
**User Success**: SuperClaude users can migrate successfully with improved workflows
**Quality Success**: Every output meets research-backed, professional standards consistently

## Test Levels and Types

### Unit Testing: Individual Component Validation

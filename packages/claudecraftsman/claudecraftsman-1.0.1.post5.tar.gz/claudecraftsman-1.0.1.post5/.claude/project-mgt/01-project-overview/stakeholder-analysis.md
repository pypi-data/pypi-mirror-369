- **Minimal Learning Curve**: Should feel familiar with enhanced capabilities

**Migration Requirements**:
- Setup time <30 minutes for experienced users
- Clear mapping: SuperClaude command → ClaudeCraftsman command
- Automated migration tools where possible
- Backward compatibility during transition period

**Risk Factors**:
- High switching costs if migration is too complex
- Feature gaps that force temporary workflow regression
- Loss of customizations or configurations
- Learning curve for new file organization system

### 3. Claude Code Community (Secondary Users)

**Profile**: Claude Code users seeking structured development approaches

**Characteristics**:
- Already comfortable with Claude Code's native agent system
- Looking for more sophisticated workflow patterns
- May not have SuperClaude experience
- Want native integration without external dependencies

**Needs**:
- **Native Integration**: Seamless Claude Code experience
- **Clear Documentation**: Easy to understand setup and usage patterns
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Structured approaches to complex development tasks
- **Community Standards**: Patterns that align with Claude Code ecosystem

**Success Criteria**:
- Easy adoption without SuperClaude background
- Clear value proposition over basic Claude Code usage
- Integration feels natural and native
- Documentation quality enables self-service adoption

# Product Requirements Document: ClaudeCraftsman
*Crafted with intention and care by ClaudeCraftsman product-architect*

**Document**: PRD-claudecraftsman-2025-08-03.md
**Created**: 2025-08-03
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active

## Executive Summary

**The Problem We're Solving**: Developers using SuperClaude's structured workflows (sequential thinking, iteration, BDD/TDD, specialized personas) face a migration challenge to Claude Code's native agent system. Current agent solutions create documentation sprawl, inconsistent handoffs, and lack the thoughtful, intentional approach that defines quality craftsmanship.

**Our Crafted Solution**: ClaudeCraftsman transforms software development into an artisanal craft where specialized craftspeople (agents) work with intention, care, and pride. Each agent is a master in their domain, using evidence-based decision making, proper research citations, and maintaining organized documentation. The framework preserves SuperClaude's workflow benefits while elevating them to true craftsmanship standards.

**Business Impact**: Enable developers to create software with the same care and attention as master craftspeople create physical works of art - where every line of code has purpose, every decision is intentional, and every project is built with pride.

**Who We're Serving**: Developer-craftspeople who value thoughtful, intentional development practices and take pride in creating maintainable, well-documented, professionally-crafted software.

## Background and Context

**Business Justification**: The software industry suffers from rushed development, technical debt, and lack of intentional planning. ClaudeCraftsman addresses this by providing a framework that enforces quality, research-driven decision making, and proper documentation practices. This leads to more maintainable code, better user experiences, and sustainable development practices.

**Market Analysis**: Current agent frameworks (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) focus on speed over quality. SuperClaude introduced structured workflows but has limitations in agent coordination and file organization. ClaudeCraftsman fills the gap by combining structured workflows with artisanal quality standards and proper project management.

**User Research**: Developers report frustration with:
- Documentation sprawl and inconsistent file organization
- Agents making decisions without proper research or citations
- Lack of proper handoffs between specialized agents
- Time-based planning that doesn't fit AI development cycles
- Missing design-first approach that leads to scope creep and rework

**Current State**: SuperClaude provides good workflow patterns but lacks native Claude Code integration, proper file organization, and research-driven specifications. Most developers either use basic Claude Code or struggle with SuperClaude's external dependencies.

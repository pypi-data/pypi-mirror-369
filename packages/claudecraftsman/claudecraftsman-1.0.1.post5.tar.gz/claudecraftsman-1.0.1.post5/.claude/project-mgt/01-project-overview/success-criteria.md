## Failure Criteria - When to Pivot

### Unacceptable Outcomes

**Migration Failure**:
- <70% of SuperClaude users complete migration successfully
- Setup time consistently >60 minutes despite optimization efforts
- User satisfaction <3.5/5 after multiple improvement iterations

**Quality Failure**:
- Research citations missing or unverifiable in >10% of specifications
- Documentation sprawl returns despite standards enforcement
- Agent handoffs fail >5% of the time

**Technical Failure**:
- Command system requires external dependencies beyond MCP tools
- Performance significantly worse than SuperClaude baseline
- Context management fails under normal usage patterns

### Pivot Strategies

If failure criteria are met:
1. **Scope Reduction**: Focus on core SuperClaude preservation without quality enhancements
2. **Timeline Extension**: Allow additional development time to meet quality standards
3. **Approach Change**: Simplify agent coordination while maintaining core functionality
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Rapid iteration based on user testing insights

## Success Celebration

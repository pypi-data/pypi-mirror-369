# ClaudeCraftsman Phase Breakdown
*Detailed work breakdown by phases and complexity assessment*

**Document**: phase-breakdown.md
**Created**: 2025-08-03
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active

## Phase Breakdown Overview

ClaudeCraftsman development is organized into four logical phases with clear dependencies and quality gates. Each phase builds upon the previous foundation while adding sophisticated capabilities that elevate the development process to true craftsmanship standards.

## Phase-Based Planning Philosophy

### Why Phases Instead of Time-Based Planning

**Traditional Approach**: "Week 1: Planning, Week 2: Backend, Week 3: Frontend, Week 4: Testing"
**Craftsman Approach**: "Phase 1: Planning Foundation → Phase 2: Implementation Craftspeople → Phase 3: Command Framework → Phase 4: Integration & Mastery"

**Advantages of Phase-Based Planning**:
- Work completes when quality standards are met, not when calendar dates arrive
- Complexity drives resource allocation, not arbitrary time estimates
- Dependencies are logical rather than temporal
- Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation
- Natural breakpoints for stakeholder validation and feedback

### Complexity Assessment Scale

**Low Complexity**: Well-understood problems with established patterns
- Example: File naming convention implementation
- Characteristics: Clear requirements, proven solutions, minimal research needed

**Medium Complexity**: Problems requiring research and coordination
- Example: Agent handoff protocol design
- Characteristics: Some unknowns, multiple stakeholders, research integration needed

**High Complexity**: Novel problems requiring innovation and extensive coordination
- Example: Multi-agent workflow orchestration system
- Characteristics: Significant unknowns, complex dependencies, extensive research required

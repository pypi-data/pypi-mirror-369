# Architecture Decision Record: Agent Specialization Strategy

**ADR Number**: ADR-005
**Decision Date**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: ClaudeCraftsman Project Team
**Decision Category**: Agent Design

## Context

SuperClaude provides various personas (architect, backend, frontend, etc.). ClaudeCraftsman needs to preserve this while adding quality standards. Options:

1. **Direct Port**: Copy SuperClaude personas exactly
2. **Enhanced Personas**: Upgrade existing personas with quality standards
3. **Craftsman Agents**: Redesign as specialized craftspeople
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Preserve familiar patterns with craftsman enhancements

## Decision

Create specialized craftsman agents that preserve SuperClaude functionality while adding artisanal quality standards.

**Agent Categories**:
- **Planning Artisans**: product-architect, design-architect, technical-planner
- **Implementation Craftspeople**: system-architect, backend-architect, frontend-developer
- **Coordination Artisans**: workflow-coordinator, context-manager

**Rationale**:
- Preserves familiar SuperClaude workflow patterns
- Adds research-driven decision making and quality standards
- Enables sophisticated agent coordination
- Supports comprehensive context management
- Allows for specialized domain expertise

## Consequences

### Positive
- SuperClaude users find familiar patterns with enhanced capabilities
- Clear specialization enables focused expertise
- Quality standards consistently applied across all agents
- Sophisticated coordination enables complex workflows
- Context preservation prevents information loss

### Negative
- More complex than simple persona copying
- Learning curve for enhanced capabilities
- Coordination overhead between specialized agents
- Risk of over-specialization reducing flexibility

### Mitigation
- Clear documentation mapping SuperClaude personas to ClaudeCraftsman agents
- Comprehensive handoff protocols to manage coordination
- Flexible agent assignment based on project needs
- Training materials for enhanced capabilities

# Architecture Decision Record: Bootstrap System Design
*Documenting critical architectural decisions for ClaudeCraftsman initialization*

**ADR Number**: ADR-008
**Decision Date**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Accepted
**Architects**: Claude AI (with human oversight)
**Decision Category**: Framework Initialization

## Context and Problem Statement

**Problem**: ClaudeCraftsman framework needs a clean initialization mechanism that:
- Activates artisanal development standards without forcing them globally
- Integrates natively with Claude Code without external dependencies
- Preserves SuperClaude workflow patterns during migration
- Maintains framework awareness across sessions
- Provides both project bootstrap and existing project activation

**Business Context**: Developers need a migration path from SuperClaude's external configuration system to Claude Code's native agent framework while preserving productivity and workflow familiarity.

**Technical Context**: Claude Code provides memory import system (`@path/to/file`) and sub-agent functionality that can be leveraged for framework activation.

## Decision Drivers

### Must Have Requirements
- **Native Integration**: No external dependencies beyond Claude Code
- **Opt-In Activation**: Framework only affects projects that explicitly adopt it
- **Session Persistence**: Framework awareness maintained across Claude Code sessions
- **SuperClaude Migration**: Preserve familiar workflow patterns and productivity
- **Quality Standards**: Enforce research-driven, time-aware development practices

### Should Have Requirements
- **Easy Setup**: Installation and activation under 30 minutes
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for adoption and usage
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing Claude Code projects unaffected
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of initialization failures

### Could Have Requirements
- **Advanced Integration**: Hooks or automation for enhanced user experience
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and quality metrics
- **Team Features**: Multi-developer coordination and standards enforcement

## Considered Options

### Option 1: SessionStart Hooks (Rejected)
**Description**: Use Claude Code's SessionStart hooks to automatically initialize framework
**Pros**:
- Automatic activation
- No manual setup per session
**Cons**:
- Only supports bash commands, not Claude commands
- Forces framework on all sessions
- No opt-in capability
- Limited customization

**Decision**: Rejected - Violates opt-in requirement and technical limitations

### Option 2: External MCP Server (Rejected)
**Description**: Create custom MCP server for framework management
**Pros**:
- Advanced functionality possible
- Centralized framework management
**Cons**:
- External dependency violates requirement
- Complex setup and maintenance
- Not available in all Claude Code installations
- Version compatibility issues

**Decision**: Rejected - Violates native integration requirement

### Option 3: CLAUDE.md Memory Imports (Selected)
**Description**: Use Claude Code's native memory import system for framework activation
**Pros**:
- Native Claude Code integration (no external dependencies)
- Opt-in activation per project
- Session persistence through memory system
- File-based configuration (transparent and editable)
- Recursive import support for modular framework
**Cons**:
- Manual activation required per project
- Depends on CLAUDE.md file discovery
- Limited to file-based configuration

**Decision**: Selected - Meets all must-have requirements with acceptable trade-offs

## Architectural Decision

### Bootstrap System Architecture

#### Global Framework Installation
```
~/.claude/claudecraftsman/          # Global framework directory
â”œâ”€â”€ framework.md                    # Core principles and standards
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                         # Agent definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ product-architect.md        # Business requirements craftsperson
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design-architect.md         # Technical specifications artisan
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflow-coordinator.md     # Multi-agent orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/                       # Command definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design.md                   # Design-first development
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflow.md                 # Multi-agent coordination
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ init-craftsman.md           # Project bootstrap
â””â”€â”€ INSTALLATION.md                 # Installation metadata
```

#### Project Activation Mechanism
```markdown
# Project CLAUDE.md content
@~/.claude/claudecraftsman/framework.md
@~/.claude/claudecraftsman/agents/product-architect.md
@~/.claude/claudecraftsman/commands/design.md
```

#### Runtime Directory Structure
```
PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/current/                   # Active specifications
â”œâ”€â”€ context/                        # Runtime context files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WORKFLOW-STATE.md           # Current workflow status
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HANDOFF-LOG.md              # Agent transition history
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CONTEXT.md                  # Project context
â””â”€â”€ project-mgt/                    # Project management (optional)
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. File-Based Import System
**Decision**: Use `@path/to/file` syntax in CLAUDE.md for framework activation
**Rationale**:
- Native Claude Code feature with proven reliability
- Transparent configuration (human-readable and editable)
- Supports modular imports for specific framework components
- Automatic context loading on session start

#### 2. Global + Project Structure
**Decision**: Global framework installation with project-specific activation
**Rationale**:
- Shared framework reduces duplication across projects
- Project-specific CLAUDE.md allows customization
- Easy updates to framework affect all projects using it
- Clean separation between framework and project code

#### 3. Opt-In Activation
**Decision**: Framework only activates when explicitly imported by project
**Rationale**:
- Respects user choice and existing workflows
- No unintended side effects on existing projects
- Allows gradual adoption and testing
- Maintains Claude Code's design philosophy

#### 4. Context Preservation Strategy
**Decision**: File-based context management in `.claude/context/`
**Rationale**:
- Survives session boundaries and system restarts
- Human-readable and debuggable
- Version controllable for team coordination
- Integrates with existing file-based Claude Code patterns

## Implementation Details

### Installation Process
1. **Framework Installation**: Copy framework files to `~/.claude/claudecraftsman/`
2. **Project Activation**: Add imports to project's `CLAUDE.md`
3. **Directory Structure**: Create `.claude/` runtime directories as needed
4. **Context Initialization**: Initialize workflow state and context files

### Quality Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Time Awareness**: All agents required to use MCP `time` tool
- **Research Requirements**: Mandatory use of MCP research tools (searxng, crawl4ai, context7)
- **Citation Standards**: All claims must include verifiable sources
- **File Organization**: Consistent naming and directory structure enforcement
- **Context Maintenance**: Mandatory context file updates with quality gates

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Framework functions with limited MCP tool availability
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific guidance for common setup and usage issues
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented steps for fixing common problems
- **Rollback Support**: Ability to disable framework without affecting project code

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Native Integration**: Seamless Claude Code experience with no external dependencies
- **User Control**: Complete user control over framework adoption and customization
- **Session Persistence**: Framework awareness maintained across all Claude Code sessions
- **Quality Standards**: Automatic enforcement of research-driven development practices
- **Migration Path**: Clear SuperClaude migration with workflow preservation

### Negative Consequences
- **Manual Setup**: Requires manual activation for each project (mitigated by /init-craftsman command)
- **File Management**: Users must maintain CLAUDE.md imports (mitigated by clear documentation)
- **Framework Updates**: Global framework updates require user awareness (documented in update procedures)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Setup Automation**: `/init-craftsman` command automates project setup
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for installation and usage
- **Update Notifications**: Clear versioning and update communication
- **Support Resources**: Troubleshooting guides and community resources

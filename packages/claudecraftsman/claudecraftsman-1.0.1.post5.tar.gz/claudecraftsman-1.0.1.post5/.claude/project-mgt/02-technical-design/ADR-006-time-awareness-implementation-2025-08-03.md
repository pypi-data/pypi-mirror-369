# Architecture Decision Record: Time Awareness Implementation

**ADR Number**: ADR-006
**Decision Date**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: ClaudeCraftsman Project Team
**Decision Category**: Quality Standards

## Context

Research-driven development requires current information, but hardcoded dates quickly become outdated. Requirements:

- All research must use current date context
- Document naming must reflect actual creation dates
- Citations must include accurate access dates
- No hardcoded dates anywhere in the system

## Decision

Implement comprehensive time awareness using MCP time tool with fallback to system time.

**Implementation**:
- All agents call time MCP tool during initialization
- Document naming uses actual current date: `PRD-project-2025-08-03.md`
- Research queries include current year/date context
- Citations include actual access dates
- Fallback to system time if MCP tool unavailable

**Rationale**:
- Ensures all temporal references are current and accurate
- Research queries return relevant, current information
- Document naming reflects actual creation dates
- Citations enable accurate verification of research timing

## Consequences

### Positive
- All documents and research reflect actual current dates
- Research queries return current, relevant information
- Citations are accurate and verifiable
- No maintenance required to update hardcoded dates

### Negative
- Dependency on MCP time tool availability
- Additional complexity in agent initialization
- Potential for time tool failures affecting functionality
- Need for fallback mechanisms

### Mitigation
- Fallback to system time when MCP tool unavailable
- Clear error handling for time tool failures
- Validation that dates are reasonable and current
- Testing with both MCP tool and fallback scenarios

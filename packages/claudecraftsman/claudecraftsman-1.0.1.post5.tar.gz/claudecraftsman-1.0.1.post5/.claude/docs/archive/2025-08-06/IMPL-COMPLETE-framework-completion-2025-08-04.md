## Usage Instructions

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/claudecraftsman.git
cd claudecraftsman
chmod +x install-framework.sh
./install-framework.sh
```

### Project Initialization
```bash
cd my-project
~/.claude/claudecraftsman/init-project.sh my-project
```

### Common Workflows
```bash

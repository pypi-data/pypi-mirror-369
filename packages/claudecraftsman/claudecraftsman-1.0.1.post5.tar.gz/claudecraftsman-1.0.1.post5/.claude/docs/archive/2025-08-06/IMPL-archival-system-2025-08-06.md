# Automatic Archival System Implementation
*Date: 2025-08-06*

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 3 of the document organization enforcement plan, creating a comprehensive automatic archival system that monitors documents for completion and archives them after a configurable age threshold.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Document Archiver (`src/claudecraftsman/core/archival.py`)

Created the core archival system with the following capabilities:

- **Completion Detection**: Multiple patterns to detect document completion status
  - Content-based detection (STATUS: COMPLETE, ✅ COMPLETE, etc.)
  - Filename-based detection (COMPLETE, FINAL, DONE markers)
  - Registry status synchronization

- **Age Calculation**: Intelligent document age determination
  - Primary: Extract date from filename (TYPE-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
  - Fallback: File modification timestamp
  - Configurable threshold (default: 7 days)

- **Archival Workflow**: Complete document lifecycle management
  - Find candidates based on completion + age
  - Archive documents with proper organization
  - Update registry with archive location
  - Create archive manifests
  - Git integration for tracking

- **Document Monitoring**: Real-time completion detection
  - Hook integration monitors document changes
  - Auto-updates registry when documents marked complete
  - Immediate archival if age threshold met

### 2. Hook Integration (`src/claudecraftsman/hooks/handlers.py`)

Enhanced the hook system to monitor document changes:

- Added DocumentArchiver to hook handler initialization
- Integrated monitoring in post-tool handler
- Automatic detection when documents are marked complete
- Seamless registry status updates

### 3. CLI Commands (`src/claudecraftsman/cli/commands/archive.py`)

Created comprehensive CLI interface for archival management:

- `cc archive scan` - Find documents ready for archival
- `cc archive auto` - Automatically archive eligible documents
- `cc archive status <file>` - Check archival status of specific document
- `cc archive manifest <date>` - Create/update archive manifest
- `cc archive config` - Show archival configuration

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/test_archival_system.py`)

Created 8 tests covering all archival functionality:

- Completion detection (content and filename)
- Document age calculation
- Candidate finding logic
- Single document archival
- Document monitoring
- Archive manifest creation
- Auto-archive functionality
- All tests passing with 100% success rate

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Completion Detection
```python
completion_patterns = [
    r'STATUS:\s*COMPLETE',
    r'STATUS:\s*Complete',
    r'## STATUS:\s*Phase \d+ COMPLETE',
    r'✅\s*COMPLETE',
    # ... more patterns
]
```

### 2. Age-Based Archival Logic
- Documents must be both complete AND ≥7 days old
- Prevents premature archival of recently completed work
- Configurable threshold for different workflows

### 3. Registry Integration
- Automatic status updates when completion detected
- Bidirectional sync between document content and registry
- Archive tracking with location and reason

### 4. Archive Organization

```

### 5. Git-Aware Operations
- Stages archived documents for commit
- Tracks document moves in git history
- Semantic commit messages for archival operations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Zero Manual Archival**: Documents automatically archived when ready
2. **Completion Tracking**: Real-time detection of document status changes
3. **Age Protection**: Prevents archiving documents still being referenced
4. **History Preservation**: Complete audit trail of archived documents
5. **Registry Integrity**: Always accurate status and location tracking

## Integration with Framework

The archival system integrates seamlessly with:

- **Hook System**: Monitors all document operations
- **Registry Manager**: Maintains document metadata
- **Git Operations**: Preserves history
- **CLI Interface**: Easy management and monitoring

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Check what's ready to archive
cc archive scan

# Archive all eligible documents
cc archive auto

# Check specific document status
cc archive status PLAN-feature-2025-08-01.md

# Create archive manifest
cc archive manifest 2025-08-06
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Age Thresholds**: Per-document-type settings
2. **Archive Policies**: Different rules for different document types
3. **Bulk Operations**: Archive by pattern or date range
4. **Archive Search**: Find documents in archives
5. **Restoration**: Unarchive documents when needed

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully completes the document organization enforcement implementation. The system now provides:

- Automatic subdirectory organization (Phase 1)
- Intelligent registry management (Phase 2)
- Automatic archival system (Phase 3)

Together, these features ensure documents are always organized, tracked, and archived appropriately with zero manual intervention required.

## STATUS: Phase 3 COMPLETE

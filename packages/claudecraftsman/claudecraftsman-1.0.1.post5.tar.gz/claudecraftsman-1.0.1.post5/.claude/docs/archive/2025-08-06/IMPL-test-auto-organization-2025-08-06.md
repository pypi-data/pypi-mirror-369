# Test Auto-Organization Implementation

## Overview
This is a test document to demonstrate the automatic organization feature.

## Purpose
When this document is created in the root of `.claude/docs/current/`, the framework enforcement system should automatically:
1. Detect that it's a framework document (IMPL-*)
2. Recognize it should not be in the root directory
3. Auto-organize it into the `implementation/` subdirectory

## Expected Behavior
- File should be moved to `.claude/docs/current/implementation/`
- Registry should be updated with the correct location
- No manual intervention required

## Status
This demonstrates Phase 1 of the document organization enforcement is working correctly.

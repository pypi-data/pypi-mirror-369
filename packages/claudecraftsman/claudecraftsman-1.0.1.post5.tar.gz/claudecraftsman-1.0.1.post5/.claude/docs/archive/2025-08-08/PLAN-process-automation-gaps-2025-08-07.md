# Process Automation and Self-Management Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - All 5 Phases Implemented

## Overview
- **Feature**: Framework process automation and self-management capabilities
- **Scope**: Archive system, migration tools, enhanced hooks, state automation
- **Timeline**: 5 phases completed in 2 days
- **Result**: Framework now has full process automation and self-management

## Requirements
- Functional archive command that actually moves completed documents
- Python-only migration tools (no shell scripts)
- Enhanced Claude Code hooks for automatic state management
- Self-enforcing framework standards
- Automated document lifecycle management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Archive System Implementation
**Goal**: Create working archive functionality in Python CLI
- Implement `archive` command in Typer CLI
- Add subcommands: check, move, restore, list
- Create intelligent archival rules (completion markers, age, status)
- Update PostToolUse hook to trigger archival checks
- Test with existing completed documents

**Deliverables**:
- `claudecraftsman archive` command group
- Automatic archival on document completion
- Archive directory structure with date-based organization

### Phase 2: Python Migration Tools
**Goal**: Convert shell scripts to Python modules
- Create `migration.py` module for shell-to-Python migration logic
- Create `compatibility.py` module for backward compatibility
- Add `migrate` command to CLI
- Remove shell scripts from framework
- Update documentation to reflect Python-only approach

**Deliverables**:
- `claudecraftsman migrate` command
- Pure Python migration functionality
- No shell script dependencies

### Phase 3: Enhanced Hook Intelligence ✅
**Goal**: Deeper Claude Code lifecycle integration
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Enhanced PostToolUse to detect document completions
- ✅ Added automatic state updates after file operations
- ✅ Implemented quality gate enforcement in PreToolUse
- ✅ Created hook chaining for complex workflows
- ✅ Added progress tracking automation

**Completed Deliverables**:
- Smart document lifecycle management (auto-archive on completion markers)
- Automatic progress log updates for significant operations
- Hook chaining (git commit → registry sync, document completion → archive)
- Enhanced PreToolUse validation with framework enforcement

### Phase 4: State Management Automation ✅
**Goal**: Self-maintaining state files
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Enhanced state update functionality to be more intelligent
- ✅ Added state consistency checks in SessionStart
- ✅ Implemented state repair functionality
- ✅ Created state history tracking
- ✅ Added rollback capabilities

**Completed Deliverables**:
- Self-healing state management with automatic repair
- Automatic progress log updates through intelligent updates
- State consistency validation on every session
- Complete audit trail of state changes
- Backup and rollback capabilities for recovery

### Phase 5: Framework Self-Enforcement ✅
**Goal**: Framework actively enforces its own standards
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Add continuous validation in background
- ✅ Implement auto-correction for common violations
- ✅ Create compliance reporting
- ✅ Add framework health metrics
- ✅ Implement self-test capabilities

**Completed Deliverables**:
- Active standard enforcement with 10 violation types
- Health monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- `cc health` command with check, monitor, report, violations subcommands
- Background validation every 5 minutes
- Auto-correction for file locations, state inconsistencies, registry sync
- Compliance reporting with JSON export

## Dependencies
- Current Python package structure (complete)
- Existing hook system (functional)
- Framework file organization (established)
- Claude Code MCP integration (available)

## Success Criteria
- Archive command successfully moves completed documents
- Zero shell scripts in framework
- Hooks automatically manage document lifecycle
- State files stay current without manual intervention
- Framework enforces its own standards consistently
- All functionality is pure Python

## Technical Approach

### Archive System Design
```python
# Archive detection rules
- Status markers: "COMPLETE", "VALIDATED", "ARCHIVED"
- Document age: Configurable threshold
- Handoff completion: Workflow state transitions
- Explicit markers: User-triggered archival
```

### Hook Enhancement Strategy
```python
# PostToolUse enhancements
- Detect file writes to .claude/docs/current/
- Parse for completion markers
- Trigger archive check
- Update state files
- Log to progress tracking
```

### Migration Tool Architecture
```python
# Pure Python migration
- Shell command parsing
- Python equivalent execution
- Progress tracking
- Rollback support
- Validation checks
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Archive with ability to restore
- **Breaking Changes**: Compatibility layer for transition
- **Hook Conflicts**: Careful hook chaining logic
- **Performance**: Efficient file operations and caching
- **User Disruption**: Gradual rollout with fallbacks

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1: Archive System Implementation
2. Create archive command structure in CLI
3. Implement basic archival functionality
4. Test with completed documents in current/
5. Add hook integration for automatic archival

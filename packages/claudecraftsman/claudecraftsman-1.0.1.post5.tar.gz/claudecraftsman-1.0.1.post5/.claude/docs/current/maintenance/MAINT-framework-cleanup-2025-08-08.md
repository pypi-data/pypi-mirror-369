# Framework Cleanup and Maintenance
*ClaudeCraftsman Framework File Organization Restoration*

**Document**: MAINT-framework-cleanup-2025-08-08.md
**Type**: Maintenance
**Created**: 2025-08-08
**Status**: Complete
**Purpose**: Clean up test files and restore framework organization standards

## Overview

This maintenance activity cleaned up the ClaudeCraftsman framework documentation structure by removing test files, fixing naming conventions, and updating registry to accurately reflect current state.

## Actions Taken

### 1. File Cleanup
**Archived 6 non-compliant/test files:**
- `PRD-test.md` - Test file missing date in filename
- `PRD-test-2025-01-01.md` - Old test file from January
- `IMPL-test-2025-01-01.md` - Old test file from January
- `bad-name.md` - Non-compliant naming convention
- `orphan.md` - Orphaned file not in registry
- `OLD-doc-2025-01-01.md` - Obsolete document

**Archive Location**: `.claude/docs/archive/2025-08-08/`
**Archive Manifest**: Created with full documentation

### 2. Registry Updates
- Removed non-existent `PRD-test-lifecycle.md` entry
- Updated document statuses (marked Phase 3 and 4 implementations as complete)
- Added archive records for cleanup activity
- Standardized document types for consistency
- Fixed purpose descriptions to be concise

### 3. State File Updates
- Updated `WORKFLOW-STATE.md` to reflect cleanup phase
- Removed references to archived test files
- Updated `progress-log.md` with cleanup activity

## Quality Standards Verification

✅ **Naming Convention Compliance**
- All remaining files follow `[TYPE]-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` pattern
- No files with non-compliant names remain in `docs/current/`

✅ **Registry Accuracy**
- Registry reflects only existing documents
- All documents have proper type, location, and status
- Archive section updated with today's cleanup

✅ **File Organization**
- Documents properly organized in subdirectories
- No orphaned files in root of `docs/current/`
- Archive structure maintained with daily folders

## Framework Health Status

After cleanup, some health check issues remain that are unrelated to file organization:
- Document health and state health show critical status
- Registry health is at 100% (our cleanup focus)
- These issues appear to be related to the enforcement system expectations

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule periodic cleanup to prevent accumulation of test files
2. **Naming Enforcement**: Use framework hooks to prevent non-compliant file creation
3. **Registry Automation**: Consider automated registry updates when files are created/moved
4. **Health Monitoring**: Address remaining health check issues in separate maintenance

## Second Cleanup Pass - Completed Plans

### Additional Actions Taken

#### Archived Completed PLAN Documents
**3 additional files archived:**
- `PLAN-python-package-refactor-2025-08-05.md` - Complete, Python package implemented
- `PLAN-test-2025-08-06.md` - Test placeholder file with no content
- `PLAN-process-automation-gaps-2025-08-07.md` - Complete, all 5 phases implemented

**Verification of Completions:**
- Python package refactor: Confirmed by existence of `/src/claudecraftsman/` directory
- Process automation: Confirmed by Phase 3 and 4 implementation documents
- All completed plans had corresponding implementation documents

#### Registry Updates (Second Pass)
- Removed all 3 PLAN entries from active documents
- Added 3 new entries to Recently Archived section
- Current active documents now contains no PLAN documents

## Impact

Framework documentation structure has been thoroughly cleaned:
1. **First Pass**: Removed 6 test/non-compliant files
2. **Second Pass**: Archived 3 completed PLAN documents
3. **Total**: 9 files archived, properly documented in manifest
4. **Result**: No orphaned files, no completed plans in current/, registry accurate

The framework now maintains craftsman standards with:
- Only active, properly named documents in `current/`
- Completed work properly archived with documentation
- Registry accurately reflecting current state
- No test files or placeholders cluttering the workspace
